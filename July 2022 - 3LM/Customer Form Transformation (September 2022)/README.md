This little side project was one I made for myself to speed up my assigned task of manually converting the exported .csv tables of farm data from QGIS
into a format to be used for customer interaction.

The automation of this task allowed me to complete it faster (including coding time), as well as allow for last minute form changes when the circumstance arose.

I created and used this small program in an evening using IDLE and Pandas.

I created the '###Run_Converter.bat' file to run the code.
