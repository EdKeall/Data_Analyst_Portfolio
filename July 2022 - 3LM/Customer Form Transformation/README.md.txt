This little side project was one I made for myself to speed up my assigned task of manually converting the exported .csv tables of farm data from QGIS
into a format to be used for customer interaction.

I created and used this small program in an evening using IDLE, NumPy and Pandas

I created the '###Run_Converter.bat' file to run the code.
