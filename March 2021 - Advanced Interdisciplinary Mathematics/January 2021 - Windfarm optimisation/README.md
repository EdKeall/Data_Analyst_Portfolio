# Windfarm Optimisation

#### This project was the first I completed in the Advanced Interdisiplinary Mathematics module at the University of Exeter. The project was undertaken as a team involving myself, James Arthur and Katie Murray.

##### Files:

- 'AIM1plots.m' (2KB) - Small optimisation model we used to find the number of small and large turbines to use

- 'AIM_COVID19_Model.R' (2KB) - The main body of work in this project. We expanded a SIRD population model to a SVIRD (suseptible, vaccinated, infected, recovered, deceased) and ran two of these models in parallel, to compare the old and young in a population. Parameters and variables were mirrored to recent statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and used to model the impact of the pandemic in the UK.

- 'AIMReport.pdf' (344KB) - The report that was created for the assessment of this project. It goes into detail on the creation and workings of our model as well as the visualisation and predictions we made using it.

- 'AIMReport_LaTeX_files' - Code and files used to create the 'AIMReport' in LaTeX.

##### Skills involved (using <b>R</b>):

1.  Data/Model visualisation using ggplot2
2.  LaTeX in R for visualisation (latex2exp)
3.  Complex Compartmental Modelling design and prediction
