# Windfarm Optimisation

#### This project was the first I completed in the Advanced Interdisiplinary Mathematics module at the University of Exeter. The project was undertaken as a team involving myself, James Arthur and Katie Murray.

##### Files:


- 'AIM1.m' (1KB) - Small optimisation model we used to find the number of small and large turbines to use on the planned windfarm. The model was designed to maximise power output, constraining for the economic costs and area of the windfarm.

- 'AIM1plots.m' (2KB) - Code visualising the optimisation model, displaying the feasible region for solutions.

- '

- 'AIM_windfarm_slides.pdf' (1099KB) - The presentation slides that were delievered at the end of this project for the assessment of this project. It covers the project brief and our workings towards our conclusion of the optimised placement and configuration of the windfarm.

- 'AIMSlides_LaTeX' - Code and files used to create the 'AIM_windfarm_slides.pdf' in LaTeX.

##### Skills involved (using <b>MATLAB</b>):

1.  Linear Programming (Optimisation Model)
2.  Travelling Salesperson Algorithm
3.  Surface Plots
4.  Linear Programming Model Visualisation
