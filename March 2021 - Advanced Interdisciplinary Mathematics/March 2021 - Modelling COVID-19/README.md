# COVID-19 Modelling Project

#### This project was the third I completed in the Advanced Interdisiplinary Mathematics module at the University of Exeter. The project was undertaken as a team invloving myself, James Arthur and Katie Murrey.

##### Files:

- 'AIM disease introduction.R' (3KB) - The introduction coding done for this third of the Advanced Interdisciplinary Mathematics (AIM) model. Within, a simple SIR (suseptible, infected, recovered) population model is constructed and visualised.

- 'AIM_COVID19_Model.R' (3KB) - The main body of work in this project. We expanded a SIRD population model to a SVIRD (suseptible, vaccinated, infected, recovered, deceased) and ran two of these models in parralel, to compare the old and young in a population. Parameters and variables were mirrored to recent statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and used to model the impact of the pandemic in the UK.

- 'AIMReport.pdf' (344KB) - The report that was created for the assessment of this project. It goes into detail on the creation and workings of our model.

- 'AIMReport_LaTeX_files' - Code and files used to create the 'AIMReport' in LaTeX.

##### Skills involved (using <b>R</b>):

1.  Data/Model visualisation using ggplot2
2.  LaTeX in R for visualisation (latex2exp)
3.  Compartmental Modelling
4.
