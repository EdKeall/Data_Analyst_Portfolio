# COVID-19 Modelling Project

#### This project was the third I completed in the Advanced Interdisiplinary Mathematics module at the University of Exeter. The project was undertaken as a team invloving myself, James Arthur and Katie Murrey.

Data Files:
- 'AIM disease.R' (3KB) - The coding done for this project. Within, a simple SIR (suseptible, infected, recovered) population model is constructed.

- 'BATS_pigment.csv' (532KB) - The second dataset contains 30 years of low freqeuncy/high accuracy Bottle sample data (lab-analysed seawater samples) taken from the same survey site in Bermuda. Depth, Time, Cruise_ID and two measures of Chl-a (pigment14 & pigment 16) were needed for this project. Sourced from simonscmap.com: https://simonscmap.com/catalog/datasets/BATS%20Pigments

Skills involved (all using Python):
