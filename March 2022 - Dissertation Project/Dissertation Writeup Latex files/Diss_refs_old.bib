	abstract = {The phenomenon of subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs) is not a unique ecological response to environmental conditions; rather, a broad range of interacting processes can contribute to the formation of persistent layers of elevated chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) that are nearly ubiquitous in stratiﬁed surface waters. Mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the SCMLs include a local maximum in phytoplankton growth rate near the nutricline, photoacclimation of pigment content that leads to elevated Chl relative to phytoplankton biomass at depth, and a range of physiologically inﬂuenced swimming behaviors in motile phytoplankton and buoyancy control in diatoms and cyanobacteria that can lead to aggregations of phytoplankton in layers, subject to grazing and physical control. A postulated typical stable water structure characterizes consistent patterns in vertical proﬁles of Chl, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and light across a trophic gradient structured by the vertical ﬂux of nutrients and characterized by the average daily irradiance at the nutricline. Hypothetical predictions can be tested using a nascent biogeochemical global ocean observing system. Partial results to date are generally consistent with predictions based on current knowledge, which has strong roots in research from the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {Stratified oceanic systems are characterized by the presence of a so-called Deep Chlorophyll a Maximum (DCM) not detectable by ocean color satellites. A DCM can either be a phytoplankton (carbon) biomass maximum (Deep Biomass Maximum, DBM), or the consequence of photoacclimation processes (Deep photoAcclimation Maximum, DAM) resulting in the increase of chlorophyll a per phytoplankton carbon. Even though these DCM (further qualified as either DBMs or DAMs) have long been studied, no global-scale assessment has yet been undertaken and large knowledge gaps still remain in relation to the environmental drivers responsible for their formation and maintenance. In order to investigate their spatial and temporal variability in the open ocean, we use a global data set acquired by more than 500 Biogeochemical-Argo floats given that DCMs can be detected from the comparative vertical distribution of chlorophyll a concentrations and particulate backscattering coefficients. Our findings show that the seasonal dynamics of the DCMs are clearly region-dependent. High-latitude environments are characterized by a low occurrence of intense DBMs, restricted to summer. Meanwhile, oligotrophic regions host permanent DAMs, occasionally replaced by DBMs in summer, while subequatorial waters are characterized by permanent DBMs benefiting from favorable conditions in terms of both light and nutrients. Overall, the appearance and depth of DCMs are primarily driven by light attenuation in the upper layer. Our present assessment of DCM occurrence and of environmental conditions prevailing in their development lay the basis for a better understanding and quantification of their role in carbon budgets (primary production and export).},

Based on the data from the Dutch water monitoring programme covering 20years, major trends in phytoplankton abundance, community structure and chlorophyll were identified. Overall C:Chla increased during the study period, particularly in coastal areas. This increase was related to an increase in average underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a decrease in nutrient concentrations. A mismatch was detected between chlorophyll a and biomass carbon trends caused by both a decrease in chlorophyll a values and an increase in biomass. In coastal waters, physiological adaptation to higher light and lower nutrient levels may have enhanced the θ, increasing from yearly averages of 12gC∗gChla−1 in 1990 to 69gC∗gChla−1 in 2010. Offshore, the increased stratification coincided with a shift towards dinoflagellate dominance. This dominance of dinoflagellates co-occurred with an increased θ yearly averages from 62gC∗gChla−1 in 1991 to 119gC∗gChla−1 in 2010. Because of these changes detected in C:Chl a ratio of multispecies phytoplankton communities, we question the validity of chlorophyll a as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and argue its possible misrepresentation of phytoplankton dynamics.},

	abstract = {In the tropics, thermal stratification (during warm conditions) may contribute to a shallowing of the mixed layer above the nutricline and a reduction in the transfer of nutrients to the surface lit-layer, ultimately limiting phytoplankton growth. Using remotely sensed observations and modelled datasets, we study such linkages in the northern Red Sea (NRS) - a typical tropical marine ecosystem. We assess the interannual variability (1998–2015) of both phytoplankton biomass and phenological indices (timing of bloom initiation, duration and termination) in relation to regional warming. We demonstrate that warmer conditions in the NRS are associated with substantially weaker winter phytoplankton blooms, which initiate later, terminate earlier and are shorter in their overall duration ({\textasciitilde} 4 weeks). These alterations are directly linked with the strength of atmospheric forcing (air-sea heat fluxes) and vertical stratification (mixed layer depth [MLD]). The interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be a good indicator of phytoplankton abundance, but appears to be less important for predicting bloom timing. These findings suggest that future climate warming scenarios may have a two-fold impact on phytoplankton growth in tropical marine ecosystems: 1) a reduction in phytoplankton abundance and 2) alterations in the timing of seasonal phytoplankton blooms.},

This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean–atmosphere CO2 exchange2. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels3 causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry4. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae5,6, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica . This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.},

	abstract = {The northwestern Mediterranean Sea (NWMS) is biologically one of the most productive Mediterranean regions. NWMS pelagic planktonic ecosystem is strongly influenced by hydrodynamics, in particular by deep convection that could significantly weaken under the influence of climate change. Here we investigate the response of this ecosystem and associated carbon cycle to the long-term evolution of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. For that we developed a tridimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model and performed two groups of annual simulations under the climate conditions of respectively the 20th and the end of 21st centuries. Our results suggest that the evolution of oceanic and atmospheric circulations does not modify the NWMS pelagic planktonic ecosystem and associated carbon cycle at a first order. However, differences mainly induced by the deep convection weakening and the surface warming are obtained at a second order. The spring bloom occurs 1 month earlier. Resulting from the decrease in nutrients availability, the bottom up control of phytoplankton development and bacteria growth by the nitrogen and phosphorus availability strengthens and the microbial loop intensifies as the small-sized plankton biomass increases. Carbon net fixation and deep export do not change significantly. The choice of the biogeochemical initial and boundary conditions does not change the representation of the ecosystem seasonal cycle, but the associated uncertainty range can be one order of magnitude larger than the predicted interannual and long-term variabilities. The uncertainty range of long-term trends associated with the physical forcing (hydrological, atmospheric, hydrodynamical, and socioeconomic) is much smaller ({\textless}10\%).},

	abstract = {Iron is an essential nutrient for all living organisms. Iron is required for the synthesis of chlorophyll and of several photosynthetic electron transport proteins and for the reduction of CO2, SO4(2-), and NO3(-) during the photosynthetic production of organic compounds. Iron concentrations in vast areas of the ocean are very low ({\textless}1 nM) due to the low solubility of iron in oxic seawater. Low iron concentrations have been shown to limit primary production rates, biomass accumulation, and ecosystem structure in a variety of open-ocean environments, including the equatorial Pacific, the subarctic Pacific and the Southern Ocean and even in some coastal areas. Oceanic primary production, the transfer of carbon dioxide into organic carbon by photosynthetic plankton (phytoplankton), is one process by which atmospheric CO2 can be transferred to the deep ocean and sequestered for long periods of time. Accordingly, iron limitation of primary producers likely plays a major role in the global carbon cycle. It has been suggested that variations in oceanic primary productivity, spurred by changes in the deposition of iron in atmospheric dust, control atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and hence global climate, over glacial-interglacial timescales. A contemporary application of this "iron hypothesis" promotes the large-scale iron fertilization of ocean regions as a means of enhancing the ability of the ocean to store anthropogenic CO2 and mitigate 21st century climate change. Recent in situ iron enrichment experiments in the HNLC regions, however, cast doubt on the efficacy and advisability of iron fertilization schemes. The experiments have confirmed the role of iron in regulating primary productivity, but resulted in only small carbon export fluxes to the depths necessary for long-term sequestration. Above all, these experiments and other studies of iron biogeochemistry over the last two decades have begun to illustrate the great complexity of the ocean system. Attempts to engineer this system are likely to provoke a similarly complex, unpredictable response.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The vertical separation of organic matter formation from respiration can lead to net carbon sequestration within the ocean’s interior, making the biological pump an important component of the global carbon cycle. Understanding the response of the biological pump to the changing environment is a prerequisite to predicting future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Will the biological pump weaken or strengthen? Currently the ocean science community is unable to confidently answer this question. Carbon flux at approximately 1000 m depth, the sequestration flux, determines the removal of carbon from the atmosphere on time scales ≥100 yr. The sequestration flux depends upon: (1) input rates of nutrients allochthonous to the ocean, (2) the export flux at the base of the euphotic zone, (3) the deviation of carbon fixation and remineralization from Redfield stoichiometry, and (4) the flux attenuation in the upper 1000 m. The biological response to increasing temperature, ocean stratification, nutrient availability and ocean acidification is frequently taxa- and ecosystem-specific and the results of synergistic effects are challenging to predict. Consequently, the use of global averages and steady state assumptions (e.g. Redfield stoichiometry, mesopelagic nutrient inventory) for predictive models is often insufficient. Our ability to predict sequestration flux additionally suffers from a lack of understanding of mesopelagic food web functioning and flux attenuation. However, regional specific investigations show great promise, suggesting that in the near future predictions of changes to the biological pump will have to be regionally and ecosystem specific, with the ultimate goal of integrating to global scales.},

Copepods often dominate the zooplankton in marine coastal zones and are prey of the majority of fish larvae. Hypotheses interpreting variations of copepod recruitment are based on the concepts of ?naupliar predation,? ?nutritional deficiency,? and ?toxic effect? of diatom diets. Contradictory laboratory and field studies have reached opposite conclusions on the effects of diatoms on copepod reproductive success, blurring our view of marine food-web energy flow from diatoms to higher consumers by means of copepods. Here we report estimates of copepod feeding selectivity and reproduction in response to seasonally changing phytoplankton characteristics measured in a highly productive coastal upwelling area off the coast of central Chile. The variable phytoplankton diversity and changing food quality had a strong and highly significant impact on the feeding selectivity, reproduction, and larval survival of three indigenous copepod species. Seasonal changes in copepod feeding behavior were related to the alternating protozoan?diatom diets, mostly based on dinoflagellates and ciliates during winter and autumn (low highly unsaturated fatty acids [HUFA]/polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA] availability), but switched to a diet of centric and chain-forming diatoms (high HUFA/PUFA availability) during the spring/summer upwelling period. Ingestion of diatom cells induced a positive effect on egg production. However, a negative relationship was found between egg hatching success, naupliar survival, and diatom ingestion. Depending on the phytoplankton species, diets had different effects on copepod reproduction and recruitment. In consequence, it seems that the classical marine food web model does not apply to some coastal upwelling systems.},

When phytoplankton food quality is high strong trophic cascades suppress phytoplankton biomass, the zooplankton can withstand intense zooplanktivory, and energy is efficiently transferred through the food web sustaining higher trophic level production. Low food quality results in trophic decoupling at the plant-animal interface, with phytoplankton biomass determined primarily by nutrient availability, zooplankton easily eliminated by fish predation, and poor energy transfer through the food web. At a given nutrient availability, food quality and zooplanktivory interact to determine zooplankton biomass which in turn determines algal biomass. High food quality resulted in intense zooplankton grazing which favored fast-growing phytoplankton taxa, whereas fish predation favored slow-growing phytoplankton. These results suggest algal food quality for herbivorous zooplankton can strongly influence the nature of aquatic food web dynamics, and can have profound effects on water quality and fisheries production.},

Calcite plates in coccolithophores make them a vital tool in global climate change studies specifically with ocean acidification.

The emergence of advanced techniques enables us to study the biological aspects of this pelagic calcifier with improved precision.

	abstract = {Established conceptual models of the initiation and progression of spring phytoplankton blooms are reconsidered in light of recent observations. We use biological simulation modelling as a tool for the analysis of spring plankton blooms in shallow, coastal waters in temperate latitudes of the North Atlantic. The model shows that interannual variability in the timing of bloom initiation arises from year-to-year differences in incident irradiation, as determined by weather (cloudiness). This variability in timing results in some years when the spring bloom occurs in cold water temperatures near 0°C. Model results suggest that due to low temperature inhibition of heterotrophic consumption, more fresh organic material is delivered to the benthos in these cold-water blooms than when the bloom occurs in waters only 3°C warmer. Thus we suggest that variable bloom timing can be important to the trophodynamic fate of bloom products. We suggest that variability in timing of spring phytoplankton blooms in offshore and open ocean waters is also related to weather, through controls on the light field and wind mixing. Our analyses of wind-driven vertical mixing demonstrate such blooms can begin following the winter period of deep convection, and prior to the vernal development of stratification, provided that wind speed is below a certain, predictable threshold, which we estimate. In such cases, there may be several spring bloom pulses, each interrupted by self-shading light limitation or vertical mixing events. Eventually the seasonal thermocline develops and nutrient exhaustion curtails bloom production. This means that the spring phytoplankton bloom in offshore and open ocean areas may be significantly more productive, result in more export production, and be more important to the carbon cycle, than has been previously assumed. Furthermore, these features of temperate marine planktonic ecosystems are not only sensitive to annual variations in weather, but also any trends that might result from greenhouse warming or other factors that affect the climate system.},

	abstract = {Increased nutrient delivery to estuarine systems results in elevated growth of primary producers. This is evidenced by high chlorophyll concentrations and increased frequency of phytoplankton blooms. However, shifts in nutrient loads to estuarine ecosystems can also cause modifications in the structure of phytoplankton communities which can have adverse impacts right through the food web. Acknowledging these modifications is imperative if response mechanisms are to be fully understood. In this study, Ireland’s current water framework directive (WFD) tool for determining the status of phytoplankton communities was built upon to encompass not only biomass and bloom frequency but also community structure (diversity and evenness) and abundance. This method allows for comparison with site- and date-specific environmental data which could give an indication of cause and effect relationships. The newly developed phytoplankton index performed well against current methods to determine ecological status. Furthermore, it had a better agreement with other physico-chemical and biological WFD parameters. Statistical analysis captured the relationship between the phytoplankton index and physico-chemical parameters, allowing for a more detailed look at the impact of disturbance on the system. The inclusion of community structure acknowledged the imbalances in the phytoplankton communities of some systems even when frequent blooms are not evident. In bloom conditions, the disparity between the chlorophyll and abundance metrics within the phytoplankton index can be linked to winter dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentra- tion and forms, temperature, and light conditions. Application of the phytoplankton index will allow not only for compliance with WFD requirements, but also a method for understanding and assessing ecosystem health of estuarine phytoplankton communities over spatial and temporal timelines in line with changes in physiochemical parameters.},

The timing of the spring bloom shows only little response to warming as such, while light appears to play a more important role in its initiation. The daily light dose needed for the start of the phytoplankton spring bloom in our experiments agrees well with a recently published critical light intensity found in a field survey of the North Atlantic (around 1.3?mol?photons?m?2?day?1). Experimental temperature elevation had a strong effect on phytoplankton peak biomass (decreasing with temperature), mean cell size (decreasing with temperature) and on the share of microplankton diatoms (decreasing with temperature). All these changes will lead to poorer feeding conditions for copepod zooplankton and, thus, to a less efficient energy transfer from primary to fish production under a warmer climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract Substantial interannual variability in marine fish recruitment (i.e., the number of young fish entering a fishery each year) has been hypothesized to be related to whether the timing of fish spawning matches that of seasonal plankton blooms. Environmental processes that control the phenology of blooms, such as stratification, may differ from those that influence fish spawning, such as temperature-linked reproductive maturation. These different controlling mechanisms could cause the timing of these events to diverge under climate change with negative consequences for fisheries. We use an earth system model to examine the impact of a high-emissions, climate-warming scenario (RCP8.5) on the future spawning time of two classes of temperate, epipelagic fishes: ?geographic spawners? whose spawning grounds are defined by fixed geographic features (e.g., rivers, estuaries, reefs) and ?environmental spawners? whose spawning grounds move responding to variations in environmental properties, such as temperature. By the century's end, our results indicate that projections of increased stratification cause spring and summer phytoplankton blooms to start 16 days earlier on average (±0.05 days SE) at latitudes {\textgreater}40°N. The temperature-linked phenology of geographic spawners changes at a rate twice as fast as phytoplankton, causing these fishes to spawn before the bloom starts across {\textgreater}85\% of this region. ?Extreme events,? defined here as seasonal mismatches {\textgreater}30 days that could lead to fish recruitment failure, increase 10-fold for geographic spawners in many areas under the RCP8.5 scenario. Mismatches between environmental spawners and phytoplankton were smaller and less widespread, although sizable mismatches still emerged in some regions. This indicates that range shifts undertaken by environmental spawners may increase the resiliency of fishes to climate change impacts associated with phenological mismatches, potentially buffering against declines in larval fish survival, recruitment, and fisheries. Our model results are supported by empirical evidence from ecosystems with multidecadal observations of both fish and phytoplankton phenology.},

	abstract = {The seasonal phytoplankton biomass distribution pattern in stratified temperate marine waters is traditionally depicted as consisting of spring and autumn blooms. The energy source supporting pelagic summer production is believed to be the spring bloom. However, the spring bloom disappears relatively quickly from the water column and a large proportion of the material sedimenting to the bottom following the spring bloom is often comprised of intact phytoplankton cells. Thus, it is easy to argue that the spring bloom is fueling the energy demands of the benthos, but more difficult to argue convincingly that energy fixed during the spring bloom is fueling the pelagic production occurring during summer months. We argue here that periodic phytoplankton blooms are occurring during the summer in the North Sea at depths of \&gt;25 m and that the accumulated new production [sensu (Dugdale and Goering, Limnol. Oceanogr., 12, 196–206, 1967)] occurring in these blooms may be greater than that occurring in the spring bloom in the same regions. Thus, such blooms may explain apparent discrepancies in production yields between different temperate marine systems.},

Phytoplankton are at the base of most marine food webs and play an important role in drawing CO2 out of the atmosphere. Using nearly 5years of simultaneous CTD, irradiance, chlorophyll a fluorescence and optical backscattering observations obtained from Slocum glider missions, we observed the subsurface phytoplankton populations across the Scotian Shelf, near Halifax (Nova Scotia, Canada) along with their physical environment. Bloom conditions were observed in each of the 5 springs, with the average chlorophyll in the upper 60m of water generally exceeding 3mgm−3. These blooms occurred when the upper water column stratification was at its lowest, in apparent contradiction of the critical depth hypothesis. A subsurface chlorophyll layer was observed each summer at about 30m depth, which was below the base of the mixed layer. This subsurface layer lasted 3–4months and contained, on average, 1/4 of the integrated water column chlorophyll found during the spring bloom. This suggests that a significant portion of the primary productivity over the Scotian Shelf occurs at depths that cannot be observed by satellites—highlighting the importance of including subsurface observations in the monitoring of future changes to primary productivity in the ocean.},

A postulated typical stable water structure characterizes consistent patterns in vertical profiles of Chl, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and light across a trophic gradient structured by the vertical flux of nutrients and characterized by the average daily irradiance at the nutricline.

The SCM layers accumulated approximately 50\% of the chlorophyll a (Chl a) standing stock in the water column, and the contribution increased to {\textgreater}70\% for high-biomass areas, suggesting the biological importance of the summer SCM in the shelf ecosystem. The spatial difference in phytoplankton biomass was caused mainly by bioavailable nitrogen concentrations, and the spatial difference in diatom size may be the result of differences in predominant species. High biomass and large diatoms dominated in the SCM layers, making the south and north of the Chukchi shelf a biological hotspot for the ecosystem's food chain and benthos of the western Arctic shelf in summer.},

	abstract = {The vertical distribution of phytoplankton cells and chlorophyll concentrations throughout the sunlit water column is rarely uniform. In many ocean regions, chlorophyll concentrations peak in distinct and persistent layers deep below the surface called subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs). SCML formation is hypothesized to reflect the consequences of phytoplankton light/macronutrient colimitation, behavior, and/or photoacclimation. We discovered unexpectedly persistent and widespread phytoplankton iron limitation and iron/light colimitation in SCMLs of the California Current and at the edge of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre using shipboard incubations, metatranscriptomics, and biogeochemical proxies. These results suggest that interactions and feedbacks between iron and light availability play an important and previously unrecognized role in controlling the productivity and biogeochemical dynamics of SCMLs.Subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs) are nearly ubiquitous in stratified water columns and exist at horizontal scales ranging from the submesoscale to the extent of oligotrophic gyres. These layers of heightened chlorophyll and/or phytoplankton concentrations are generally thought to be a consequence of a balance between light energy from above and a limiting nutrient flux from below, typically nitrate (NO3). Here we present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that iron (Fe) limits or with light colimits phytoplankton communities in SCMLs along a primary productivity gradient from coastal to oligotrophic offshore waters in the southern California Current ecosystem. SCML phytoplankton responded markedly to added Fe or Fe/light in experimental incubations and transcripts of diatom and picoeukaryote Fe stress genes were strikingly abundant in SCML metatranscriptomes. Using a biogeochemical proxy with data from a 40-y time series, we find that diatoms growing in California Current SCMLs are persistently Fe deficient during the spring and summer growing season. We also find that the spatial extent of Fe deficiency within California Current SCMLs has significantly increased over the last 25 y in line with a regional climate index. Finally, we show that diatom Fe deficiency may be common in the subsurface of major upwelling zones worldwide. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the biogeochemical consequences of marine SCML formation and maintenance.},

Foremost among such frameworks has been the mandala of Margalef. His 1978 paper has been increasingly referred to in the past decade as simplified ecological schemes have been sought to help predict the effect of climate change on phytoplankton. However, the mandala is based on an understanding of the subject that is over 40 years old, when observational studies were largely limited to the coastal ocean and to near surface waters. Furthermore, most recent reproductions of the mandala are significant oversimplifications of Margalef’s original. In these simplified mandala-type constructs, diatoms, in particular, have commonly been cast as a single plankton functional type that thrive in turbulent waters and decrease in abundance with increasing stratification. On this basis, it is widely predicted that diatom productivity and hence the effectiveness of the marine biological carbon pump will decrease with climate change that is driving increased stratification of the oceans. But Margalef’s original took a more refined approach and depicted diatom genera that were adapted to more stratified conditions such as those characteristic of the subtropical oligotrophic gyres. If we now draw on the vast advances in observational oceanography of recent decades it is evident that diatoms may thrive, bloom and generate significant export even in the most intensely stratified and apparently oligotrophic conditions. Indeed, some diatom species have unique adaptations to such environments. We therefore suggest that it is time to abandon oversimplified schemes and recognize the diverse ecology of diatoms.},

As other variables become more readily available, both from remote sensing and in situ autonomous platforms, we should ask if other indices of biomass might be preferable. Herein, we compare the accuracy of different proxies of phytoplankton biomass for estimating the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) and the initial slope of the production versus irradiance (P vs. E) curve (a). The proxies compared are: the total chlorophyll a concentration (Tchla, the sum of chlorophyll a and divinyl chlorophyll), the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, the phytoplankton photosynthetic absorption coefficient, the active fluorescence in situ, the particulate scattering coefficient at 650 nm (bp (650)), and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 650 nm (bbp (650)). All of the data (about 170 P vs. E curves) were collected in the South Pacific Ocean. We find that when only the phytoplanktonic biomass proxies are available, bp (650) and Tchla are respectively the best estimators of Pmax and alpha. When additional variables are available, such as the depth of sampling, the irradiance at depth, or the temperature, Tchla becomes the best estimator of both Pmax and a. From a remote sensing perspective, error propagation analysis shows that, given the current algorithms errors for estimating bbp(650), Tchla remains the best estimator of Pmax.},

	abstract = {Chlorophyll has long functioned as the prominent field metric for phytoplankton biomass, but its variability can be strongly influenced by (even dominated by) physiological shifts in intracellular pigmentation in response to changing growth conditions (light, nutrients, temperature). The particulate beam attenuation coefficient (cp) may offer an alternative optical measure of phytoplankton biomass that is readily assessed in situ and relatively insensitive to changes in intracellular pigment content. Unlike chlorophyll, however, cp is not uniquely associated with phytoplankton and varies as well with changes in inorganic, detrital, and heterotrophic particles. In open ocean environments, particles in the size range of ∼0.5 to 20 m (i.e., within the phytoplankton size domain) dominate cp. Multiple field studies have indicated that the ratio of cp to chlorophyll (i.e., c*p) registers first-order changes in algal physiology, suggesting that cp covaries with phytoplankton carbon biomass. Here we use approximately 10,000 measurements of cp and fluorescence-based chlorophyll estimates (ChlFl) to evaluate the correspondence between these two phytoplankton biomass proxies. Our study focuses on a region of the eastern equatorial Pacific where mixed layer growth conditions are relatively homogeneous, thereby constraining phytoplankton chlorophyll:carbon ratios and allowing chlorophyll to function as a reliable measure of phytoplankton biomass. Over our 6600 km transect, cp was exceptionally well correlated with ChlFl (r2 = 0.93). Our results contribute additional support for cp as a viable index of phytoplankton carbon biomass in the open ocean.},

	abstract = {We present a new dynamic model that uses a small number of prescribed parameters to predict the chlorophyll a:carbon ratio and growth rate of phytoplankton in both constant and varying irradiance. The model provides a self-contained description of energy and mass fluxes and regulation of partitioning of photosynthate during phytoplankton adaptation to irradiance. The kinetics and steady-state outcomes of photoadaptation are described in terms of changes in the rates of synthesis of three intracellular carbon pools. These pools account for the distribution of cell material between light-harvesting components, the biosynthetic apparatus, and energy storage compounds. Regulation of the flow of recent photosynthate to these pools is controlled by the ratio of realized to potential photosynthetic electron flow at a given instant. The responses of growth rate and Chl a:C to static and dynamic irradiance regimes can be adequately described by specifying four parameters: the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve, the maximum growth rate, the maximum Chl a:C observed under light limitation, and the maintenance metabolic rate. The model predictions compared favorably with observations of the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaedactylum tricornutum.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs) is not a unique ecological response to environmental conditions; rather, a broad range of interacting processes can contribute to the formation of persistent layers of elevated chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) that are nearly ubiquitous in stratified surface waters. Mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the SCMLs include a local maximum in phytoplankton growth rate near the nutricline, photoacclimation of pigment content that leads to elevated Chl relative to phytoplankton biomass at depth, and a range of physiologically influenced swimming behaviors in motile phytoplankton and buoyancy control in diatoms and cyanobacteria that can lead to aggregations of phytoplankton in layers, subject to grazing and physical control. A postulated typical stable water structure characterizes consistent patterns in vertical profiles of Chl, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and light across a trophic gradient structured by the vertical flux of nutrients and characterized by the average daily irradiance at the nutricline. Hypothetical predictions can be tested using a nascent biogeochemical global ocean observing system. Partial results to date are generally consistent with predictions based on current knowledge, which has strong roots in research from the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {In oligotrophic lakes and oceans, the deep chlorophyll maximum may form independently of a maximum of phytoplankton biomass, because the ratio of chlorophyll to phytoplankton biomass (in units of carbon) increases with acclimation to reduced light and increased nutrient supply at depth. Optical data (beam attenuation as proxy for phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence and absorption as proxies for chlorophyll concentration) and conventional measurements of biovolume, particulate organic carbon, and chlorophyll from two oligotrophic systems (Crater Lake, Oregon, and Sta. ALOHA in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean) are presented and show a vertical separation of the maxima of biomass and chlorophyll by 50?80 m during stratified conditions. We use a simple mathematical framework to describe the vertical structure of phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and chlorophyll and to explore what processes contribute to the generation of vertical maxima. Consistent with the observations, the model suggests that biomass and chlorophyll maxima in stable environments are generated by fundamentally different mechanisms. Maxima in phytoplankton biomass occur where the growth rate is balanced by losses (respiration and grazing) and the divergence in sinking velocity, whereas the vertical distribution of chlorophyll is strongly determined by photoacclimation. A deep chlorophyll maximum is predicted well below the particle maximum by the model. As an interpretation of these results, we suggest a quantitative criterion for the observed coexistence of vertically distinct phytoplankton assemblages in oligotrophic systems: the vertical position at which a species occurs in highest abundance in the water column is determined by the ?general compensation depth?? that is, the depth at which specific growth and all loss rates, including the divergence of sinking/swimming and vertical mixing, balance. This prediction can be tested in the environment when the divergence of sinking and swimming is negligible.},

Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of ∼1\% of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.},

The regime shift in phytoplankton was related to gradual changes in nutrient levels, but unrelated to an almost concurrent shift in climatic conditions. The relationship between total phytoplankton biomass and phosphorus concentrations was sigmoid. Trajectories of phytoplankton biomass and community dynamics suggest that eutrophication effects can successfully be reversed when management efforts decrease nutrient loading to a level sufficiently low to overcome community resilience. The regime shift was associated with a loss of biomass compensation and compensatory dynamics among the phytoplankton groups. This suggests that the type of interactions is important for a better understanding of the existence and shape of nonlinear responses of phytoplankton biomass to environmental change.},

Two new data sets created from the relationship between the PCI and SeaWiFS chlorophyll a (Chl a) quantify differences in the previous and current regimes for both the anthropogenically affected coastal North Sea and the comparatively unaffected open North Sea. The new regime maintains a 13\% higher Chl a concentration in the open North Sea and a 21\% higher concentration in coastal North Sea waters. However, the current regime has lower total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations than the previous regime, although the molar N: P ratio in coastal waters is now well above the Redfield ratio and continually increasing. Besides becoming warmer, North Sea waters are also becoming clearer (i.e., less turbid), thereby allowing the normally light-limited coastal phytoplankton to more effectively utilize lower concentrations of nutrients. Linear regression analyses indicate that winter Secchi depth and sea surface temperature are the most important predictors of coastal Chl a, while Atlantic inflow is the best predictor of open Chl a; nutrient concentrations are not a significant predictor in either model. Thus, despite decreasing nutrient concentrations, Chl a continues to increase, suggesting that climatic variability and water transparency may be more important than nutrient concentrations to phytoplankton production at the scale of this study.},

	abstract = {Ecological regime shifts and carbon cycling in aquatic systems have both been subject to increasing attention in recent years, yet the direct connection between these topics has remained poorly understood. A four-fold increase in sedimentation rates was observed within the past 50 years in a shallow eutrophic lake with no surface in- or outflows. This change coincided with an ecological regime shift involving the complete loss of submerged macrophytes, leading to a more turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. To determine whether the increase in carbon (C) burial resulted from a comprehensive transformation of C cycling pathways in parallel to this regime shift, we compared the annual C balances (mass balance and ecosystem budget) of this turbid lake to a similar nearby lake with submerged macrophytes, a higher transparency, and similar nutrient concentrations. C balances indicated that roughly 80\% of the C input was permanently buried in the turbid lake sediments, compared to 40\% in the clearer macrophyte-dominated lake. This was due to a higher measured C burial efficiency in the turbid lake, which could be explained by lower benthic C mineralization rates. These lower mineralization rates were associated with a decrease in benthic oxygen availability coinciding with the loss of submerged macrophytes. In contrast to previous assumptions that a regime shift to phytoplankton dominance decreases lake heterotrophy by boosting whole-lake primary production, our results suggest that an equivalent net metabolic shift may also result from lower C mineralization rates in a shallow, turbid lake. The widespread occurrence of such shifts may thus fundamentally alter the role of shallow lakes in the global C cycle, away from channeling terrestrial C to the atmosphere and towards burying an increasing amount of C.},

Vertical profiles from different regions of the sea are presented; each has a deep chlorophyll maximum, but the probable mechanisms of their formation and maintenance differ widely. Most vertical distributions of chlorophyll can be explained by the interaction between hydrography and growth, behavior, or physiological adaptation of phytoplankton with no special consideration of grazing by herbivores, even though vertical distributions of epizooplankton are not uniform.

A DCM can either be a phytoplankton (carbon) biomass maximum (Deep Biomass Maximum, DBM), or the consequence of photoacclimation processes (Deep photoAcclimation Maximum, DAM) resulting in the increase of chlorophyll a per phytoplankton carbon. Even though these DCM (further qualified as either DBMs or DAMs) have long been studied, no global-scale assessment has yet been undertaken and large knowledge gaps still remain in relation to the environmental drivers responsible for their formation and maintenance. In order to investigate their spatial and temporal variability in the open ocean, we use a global data set acquired by more than 500 Biogeochemical-Argo floats given that DCMs can be detected from the comparative vertical distribution of chlorophyll a concentrations and particulate backscattering coefficients. Our findings show that the seasonal dynamics of the DCMs are clearly region-dependent. High-latitude environments are characterized by a low occurrence of intense DBMs, restricted to summer. Meanwhile, oligotrophic regions host permanent DAMs, occasionally replaced by DBMs in summer, while subequatorial waters are characterized by permanent DBMs benefiting from favorable conditions in terms of both light and nutrients. Overall, the appearance and depth of DCMs are primarily driven by light attenuation in the upper layer. Our present assessment of DCM occurrence and of environmental conditions prevailing in their development lay the basis for a better understanding and quantification of their role in carbon budgets (primary production and export).},

Over 33 years (1980–2013), 415 species from 122 genera have been identified to species level, being mostly diatoms (371 species), with 10 new species described with local material (6 diatoms, 4 cyanobacteria). The importance of diatoms was indicated by the frequent occurrence of Corethron pennatum, Pseudogomphonema kamtshaticum, and abundant benthic genera in the plankton (e.g. Navicula, Cocconeis). The increased contribution of dinoflagellates after 2010 suggests marked changes in the water column. Early-summer blooms differ between the bays' eastern and western shores, with terrestrial melting and wind-driven upwelling inducing the dominance of benthic species at eastern shores, whereas planktonic diatoms (Thalassiosira, Pseudo-nizschia, and Chaetoceros) are most abundant along western shores and central areas. The importance of an accurate identification of organisms that are becoming key ecological components of the region is discussed, as recent changes in the microflora may affect the entire marine food web.},

However, the role of eddies in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry has received less attention. Previous studies have been based on satellites or models. In this study, Southern Ocean eddies were matched with BGC-Argo float profiles to investigate the subsurface biological structure of Southern Ocean eddies. We focused on four frontal regions in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean where data density is greater than in the other basins. The seasonality and regional variability of subsurface chlorophyll and backscatter structures were revealed by calculating anomalies in eddies relative to outside of eddies, in each season and frontal region. Chlorophyll anomalies in the mixed layer were mostly positive for both cyclones and anticyclones in all regions in spring, summer and autumn. Anomalies in winter were close to zero. Eddy pumping was the most likely mechanism sustaining high chlorophyll in cyclones. Eddy-induced Ekman pumping, in combination with deep vertical mixing was likely the driver of enhanced chlorophyll in anticyclones. Backscatter anomalies were mostly consistent with chlorophyll anomalies. Chlorophyll to backscatter ratios (chlorophyll:bbp) were also calculated to help understand the role of light acclimation in the phytoplankton. There were strong subsurface maxima for in-eddy chlorophyll:bbp in spring and summer. Such structures were weak in autumn and winter, but chlorophyll:bbp in the upper 30 m in autumn and winter was mostly higher than spring and summer in the same region. Photo-acclimation to low light at depth was evident for both cyclones and anticyclones in spring and summer in the euphotic zone, while in autumn and winter it was observed throughout the upper water column. The majority of positive chlorophyll anomalies were due to both an increase of biomass and photo-acclimation while few cases were due to photo-acclimation only.},

The ISO method is accepted as a standard method but requires sample handling and transport to the laboratory. Spectrofluorometry is a sensitive method, even for natural phytoplankton populations. Nevertheless, it cannot be recommended for the quantification of cyanobacterial water blooms because colonial and filamentous species such as Microcystis, Anabaena, or Aphanizomenon display unacceptable variability (18–33\%).

This probe can provide the selective measurement of technologically important phytoplankton groups like cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and cryptophytes in lake vertical profiles of up to 100m. The limitation of this instrument is the possible reabsorption of the light signal, e.g. in the presence of humic substances, or dense algal blooms. The use of submersible probes for in situ phytoplankton quantification can be recommended as a sensitive tool for water management, especially in the case of drinking water resources.},

	abstract = {The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) commenced monthly sampling in October 1988 as part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program. The goals of the US JGOFS time-series research are to better understand the basic processes that control ocean biogeochemistry on seasonal to decadal time-scales, determine the role of the oceans in the global carbon budget, and ultimately improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on ecosystems. The BATS program samples the ocean on a biweekly to monthly basis, a strategy that resolves major seasonal patterns and interannual variability. The core cruises last 4–5d during which hydrography, nutrients, particle flux, pigments and primary production, bacterioplankton abundance and production, and often complementary ancillary measurements are made. This overview focuses on patterns in ocean biology and biogeochemistry over a decade at the BATS site, concentrating on seasonal and interannual changes in community structure, and the physical forcing and other factors controlling the temporal dynamics. Significant seasonal and interannual variability in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production, biomass, and community structure exists at BATS. No strong relationship exists between primary production and particle flux during the 10yr record, with the relationship slightly improved by applying an artificial lag of 1 week between production and flux. The prokaryotic picoplankton regularly dominate the phytoplankton community; diatom blooms are rare but occur periodically in the BATS time series. The increase in Chl a concentrations during bloom periods is due to increases by most of the taxa present, rather than by any single group, and there is seasonal succession of phytoplankton. The bacterioplankton often dominate the living biomass, indicating the potential to consume large amounts of carbon and play a major ecological role within the microbial food web. Bacterial biomass, production, and specific growth rates are highest during summer. Size structure and composition of the plankton community may be an important factor controlling the quality of dissolved organic matter produced and could affect production of bacterioplankton biomass. Larger heterotrophic plankton play an integral role in the flux of material out of the euphotic zone at BATS. Protozoans are abundant and can constitute a sizable component of sinking flux. Zooplankton contribute significantly to flux via production of rapidly sinking fecal pellets, and vertically migrating zooplankton can actively transport a significant amount of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen to deep water. An important question that remains to be further addressed at BATS is how larger climatological events drive some of the interannual variability in the biogeochemistry.},

	abstract = {In situ chlorophyll fluorometers have been used to quantify the distribution of chlorophyll concentration in natural waters for decades. However, chlorophyll fluorescence is depressed during daylight hours due to non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Corrections attempted to date have provided improvement but still remain unsatisfactory, often over-estimating the expected value. In this study, we examine the relationship between NPQ and instantaneous Photosynthetically Active Radiation (iPAR) using field data from BGC-Argo floats equipped with Chlorophyll-a fluorometers and radiometers. This analysis leads to an improved NPQ correction that incorporates both iPAR and mixed layer depth (MLD) and is validated against data collected at sunrise or sunset. The optimal NPQ light threshold is found to be iPAR = 15 \&\#x03BC;mol quanta m\&\#x2212;2 s\&\#x2212;1, and the proposed methods based on such a light threshold correct the NPQ effect more accurately than others, except in \&\#x201C;shallow-mixing\&\#x201D; waters (NPQ light threshold depth deeper than MLD). For these waters, an empirical-relationship-based method is proposed for improvement of NPQ correction using an iPAR profile. It is therefore recommended that, for optimal NPQ corrections, profiling floats measuring chlorophyll fluorescence in daytime be equipped with iPAR radiometers.},

	abstract = {The present study examines the potential of using the near-surface chlorophyll a concentration ([Chla]surf), as it can be derived from ocean color observation, to infer the column-integrated phytoplankton biomass, its vertical distribution, and ultimately the community composition. Within this context, a large High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigment database was analyzed. It includes 2419 vertical pigment profiles, sampled in case 1 waters with various trophic states (0.03?6 mg Chla m?3). The relationships between [Chla]surf and the chlorophyll a vertical distribution, as previously derived by Morel and Berthon (1989), are fully confirmed. This agreement makes it possible to go further and to examine if similar relationships between [Chla]surf and the phytoplankton assemblage composition along the vertical can be derived. Thanks to the detailed pigment composition, and use of specific pigment biomarkers, the contribution to the local chlorophyll a concentration of three phytoplankton groups can be assessed. With some cautions, these groups coincide with three size classes, i.e., microplankton, nanoplankton and picoplankton. Corroborating previous regional findings (e.g., large species dominate in eutrophic environments, whereas tiny phytoplankton prevail in oligotrophic zones), the present results lead to an empirical parameterization applicable to most oceanic waters. The predictive skill of this parameterization is satisfactorily tested on a separate data set. With such a tool, the vertical chlorophyll a profiles of each group can be inferred solely from the knowledge of [Chla]surf. By combining this tool with satellite ocean color data, it becomes possible to quantify on a global scale the phytoplankton biomass associated with each of the three algal assemblages.},

	abstract = {Marine primary production influences the transfer of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere, and the availability of energy for the pelagic food web. Both the rate and the fate of organic carbon from primary production are dependent on phytoplankton size. A key aim of the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) programme has been to quantify biological carbon cycling in the Atlantic Ocean and measurements of total primary production have been routinely made on AMT cruises, as well as additional measurements of size-fractionated primary production on some cruises. Measurements of total primary production collected on the AMT have been used to evaluate remote-sensing techniques capable of producing basin-scale estimates of primary production. Though models exist to estimate size-fractionated primary production from satellite data, these have not been well validated in the Atlantic Ocean, and have been parameterised using measurements of phytoplankton pigments rather than direct measurements of phytoplankton size structure. Here, we re-tune a remote-sensing primary production model to estimate production in three size fractions of phytoplankton ({\textless}2μm, 2–10μm and {\textgreater}10μm) in the Atlantic Ocean, using measurements of size-fractionated chlorophyll and size-fractionated photosynthesis-irradiance experiments conducted on AMT 22 and 23 using sequential filtration-based methods. The performance of the remote-sensing technique was evaluated using: (i) independent estimates of size-fractionated primary production collected on a number of AMT cruises using 14C on-deck incubation experiments and (ii) Monte Carlo simulations. Considering uncertainty in the satellite inputs and model parameters, we estimate an average model error of between 0.27 and 0.63 for log10-transformed size-fractionated production, with lower errors for the small size class ({\textless}2μm), higher errors for the larger size classes (2–10μm and {\textgreater}10μm), and errors generally higher in oligotrophic waters. Application to satellite data in 2007 suggests the contribution of cells {\textless}2μm and {\textgreater}2μm to total primary production is approximately equal in the Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {During its lifetime, a space-borne ocean color sensor provides world-wide information about important biogeochemical properties of the upper ocean every 2 to 4 days in cloudless regions. Merging simultaneous or complementary data from such sensors to obtain better spatial and temporal coverage is a recurring objective, but it can only be reached if the consistency of the sensor-specific products, as delivered by the various Space Agencies, has first been carefully examined. The goal of the present study is to provide a procedure for establishing a coherency of open ocean (Case-1 waters) data products, for which the various data processing methods are sufficiently similar. The development of the procedure includes a detailed comparison of the marine algorithms used (after atmospheric corrections) by space agencies for the production of standard products, such as the chlorophyll concentration, [Chl], and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd. The MODIS-Aqua, SeaWiFS and MERIS [Chl] products agree over a wide range, between ∼0.1 and 3 mg m−3, whereas increasing divergences occur for oligotrophic waters ([Chl] (from 0.02 to 0.09 mg m−3). For the Kd(490) coefficient, different algorithms are in use, with differing results. Based on a semi-analytical reflectance model and hyperspectral approach, the present work proposes a harmonization of the algorithms allowing the products of the various sensors to be comparable, and ultimately, meaningfully merged (the merging procedures themselves are not examined). Additional potential products, obtained by using [Chl] as an intermediate tool, are also examined and proposed. These products include the thickness of the layer heated by the sun, the depth of the euphotic zone, and the Secchi disk depth. The physical limitations in the predictive skill of such downward extrapolations, made from information concerning only the upper layer, are stressed.},

Calculating the surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2sw) from float pH has uncertainty contributions from the pH sensor, the alkalinity estimate, and carbonate system equilibrium constants, resulting in a relative standard uncertainty in pCO2sw of 2.7\% (or 11?µatm at pCO2sw of 400?µatm). The calculated pCO2sw from several floats spanning a range of oceanographic regimes are compared to existing climatologies. In some locations, such as the subantarctic zone, the float data closely match the climatologies, but in the polar Antarctic zone significantly higher pCO2sw are calculated in the wintertime implying a greater air-sea CO2 efflux estimate. Our results based on four representative floats suggest that despite their uncertainty relative to direct measurements, the float data can be used to improve estimates for air-sea carbon flux, as well as to increase knowledge of spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability in this flux.},

Seasonality and interannual dynamics of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and small eukaryotic algae ({\textless}12μm diameter) abundance, cellular carbon content (QC; particulate organic carbon; POC cell−1), and group-specific carbon biomass are reported. QC of individual taxa varied with depth and season by as much as an order of magnitude, roughly comparable to variability in abundance. During the time-series there were obvious shifts in the taxonomic distribution of photosynthetic carbon biomass; these interannual shifts in biomass were due to simultaneous changes in both QC and cell abundance. The observed pattern was not apparent from numerical abundance alone, highlighting the importance of QC measurements in place of using fixed conversion factors to better understand biological carbon dynamics. Changes in the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from positive to negative modes correlated with shifts in biomass between picocyanobacteria and small eukaryotic algae, respectively. Thus, shifts in algal community structure are inferred to be associated with changes in light intensity and implied nutrient supply via mixing (i.e., patterns in upper ocean stability). These observed changes in phytoplankton biomass partitioning were correlated with the important ocean carbon cycle parameters of export flux, mesopelagic transfer efficiency, and elemental stoichiometry. Importantly, interannual relationships between these parameters and algal biomass were detected only when QC was considered as variable.},

This study assesses the spectral properties of sedimentary chlorophyll a using visible-near infrared reflectance (VNIR) spectroscopy, with the objective of establishing a new, non-destructive paleolimnological proxy. Reflectance spectra were determined from a dilution series (n = 10) involving incremental additions of pulverized modern algae to a lake sediment matrix of low organic content. This enabled an assessment of the development of sediment reflectance spectra in relation to different sediment chlorophyll a concentrations, and subsequent regression of spectral features against measured concentrations of chlorophyll a and derivatives obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The experiment demonstrates that ubiquitous troughs in sediment reflectance near 675 nm are attributable to chlorophyll a and derivative compounds. A significant correlation (r2 = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.01) was obtained between the area of the reflectance trough in the 650–700 nm interval and summed concentrations of chlorophyll a, all derivative isomers, and degradational pheopigments. A simple linear inference model derived from this experiment was applied to a down-core sequence of VNIR spectra from a productive prairie lake (Alberta, Canada), where it produced inferred sediment chlorophyll a concentrations in concordance with HPLC measurements. Although a larger training set is desirable to further refine the inference model, the analyses reported here demonstrate that reflectance spectroscopy provides a rapid, semi-quantitative method for assessing the chlorophyll a content of lake sediments.},

	abstract = {Marine diatoms as indicators of modern environment change A substantial part of the ocean’s primary productivity is provided by diatoms (Tréguer et al., 1995). In general, they are the dominant primary producers in temperate and cold areas, and are very abundant in the recently upwelled waters of Eastern Boundary Currents and in diverging surface currents where nutrients are brought to the surface (Nelson et al., 1995, and references therein). On an annual basis, the relative contribution of diatoms to primary productivity is highly variable: Nelson et al. (1995) and Tréguer et al. (1995) proposed upper limits of 35\% in oligotrophic areas and up to 75\% in coastal upwelling areas and other nutrient-rich systems. Regardless of the area, the general trend is for an increase in the relative abundance of diatoms in the phytoplankton together with primary productivity (Ragueneau et al., 2000). As a general statement we may say that diatoms are the dominant primary producers in a number of oceanographic settings that offer both the required high-nutrient and turbulence conditions (e.g. coastal upwelling areas, equatorial divergences, ice-edges, river plumes; Ragueneau et al., 2000). In contrast, small, non-siliceous pico- and nanoplankton are of great importance to total productivity in oligotrophic regions (Tréguer et al., 1995, and references therein).},

	abstract = {Over timescales of months to years, the export of organic nitrogen from the oceanic euphotic zone (principally as sinking particulate nitrogen, PN) is believed to balance the input of exogenous combined inorganic nitrogen (i.e., export production balances new production). In the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre, there are two significant sources of new nitrogen: the upward flux of nitrate from deep water and the biological fixation of dissolved N2 in near-surface waters. Because these sources have distinct stable isotopic signatures, we were able to use the total PN and ?15N measurements of sinking particles and an isotopic mass balance model to deconvolute the relative and absolute contributions of the nitrate flux and nitrogen fixation to the gravitational export of PN. The sinking flux of PN and its isotopic composition both varied widely between 1989 and 2001. Seasonally, N2 fixation correlated inversely with mixed-layer depth, reaching a maximum in June-August, whereas nitrate-supported export correlated inversely with sea surface temperature, reaching a maximum in February-March. These patterns were consistent with summertime increases in diazotroph biomass and water column N2 fixation rates, as indicated by phycoerythrin pigment concentrations and 15N2 tracer studies. Annually, the relative contribution of N2 fixation to N export varied from 36 to 69\% (mean = 48\%) and showed a significant increasing trend over the period of observation. Although total PN export correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index, the nitrate- and nitrogen fixation-based components appeared to respond to climate forcing in distinct ways, complicating our interpretation of the mechanisms of climate-induced changes in particle export.},

The variability patterns on seasonal and inter-annual oscillation periods were confirmed using the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), and Morlet wavelet transform analyses, respectively. The first EOF mode for Chl-a was dominated by obvious spring and fall blooms in a spatial pattern that was related to the strong mixing of the water masses from the Yellow Sea Cold Warm Mass (YSCWM) and the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) in winter. The second EOF mode for Chl-a showed an opposite spatial pattern between the northern and southern regions. The temporal coefficient showed differences in the timing of blooms. On an inter-annual scale, Chl-a indicated variation at periods of 2–4 years during 2003–2015. Chl-a showed a significantly negative correlation with the sea surface temperature (r = -0.21, p{\textless}0.01), with time lags of 4 months (Chl-a ahead). Chl-a was coupled with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, with a positive correlation (r = 0.46, p{\textless}0.01) at a lag of 3–5 months (ENSO ahead). The present study demonstrated that the variation in phytoplankton biomass was controlled primarily by water mass seasonally, and it was influenced by ENSO events on an inter-annual scale.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: There is growing evidence that average global phytoplankton concentrations have been changing over the past century, yet published trajectories of change are highly divergent. Here, we review and analyze 115 published phytoplankton trend estimates originating from a wide variety of sampling instruments to explore the underlying patterns and ecological implications of phytoplankton change over the period of oceanographic measurement (1889 to 2010). We found that published estimates of phytoplankton change were much less variable when estimated over longer time series and consistent spatial scales and from the same sampling instruments. Average phytoplankton concentrations tended to increase over time in near-shore waters and over more recent time periods and declined in the open oceans and over longer time periods. Most published evidence suggests changes in temperature and nutrient supply rates as leading causes of these phytoplankton trends. In near-shore waters, altered coastal runoff and increased nutrient flux from land may primarily explain widespread increases in phytoplankton there. Conversely, in the open oceans, increasing surface temperatures are strengthening water column stratification, reducing nutrient flux from deeper waters and negatively influencing phytoplankton. Phytoplankton change is further affected by biological processes, such as changes in grazing regimes and nutrient cycling, but these effects are less well studied at large scales. The possible ecosystem consequences of observed phytoplankton changes include altered species composition and abundance across multiple trophic levels, effects on fisheries yield, and changing patterns of export production. We conclude that there is evidence for substantial changes in phytoplankton concentration over the past century, but the magnitude of these changes remains uncertain at a global scale; standardized long-term measurements of phytoplankton abundance over time can substantially reduce this uncertainty.},

Specifically, skill was assessed based on the models' ability to estimate the observed mean, variability, and trends of NPP. At both sites, more than 90\% of the models underestimated mean NPP, with the average bias of the BOGCMs being nearly twice that of the ocean color models. However, the difference in overall skill between the best BOGCM and the best ocean color model at each site was not significant. Between 1989 and 2007, in situ NPP at BATS and HOT increased by an average of nearly 2\% per year and was positively correlated to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. The majority of ocean color models produced in situ NPP trends that were closer to the observed trends when chlorophyll-a was derived from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), rather than fluorometric or SeaWiFS data. However, this was a function of time such that average trend magnitude was more accurately estimated over longer time periods. Among BOGCMs, only two individual models successfully produced an increasing NPP trend (one model at each site). We caution against the use of models to assess multiannual changes in NPP over short time periods. Ocean color model estimates of NPP trends could improve if more high quality HPLC chlorophyll-a time series were available.},

High water temperatures in 1998 killed enormous amounts of corals in tropical seas, though in the Caribbean region the effects at that time appeared less marked than in the Indo-Pacific. However, SSTs are rising in accordance with world-wide trends and it has been predicted that temperature will become increasingly important in this region in the near future.

Results were obtained from 26 models in the Community Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive and 30 simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Large Ensemble Community Project (CESM-LENS). All of the simulations used the observed greenhouse gas concentrations for 1976–2005 and the RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario for greenhouse gases through the remainder of the 21st century. In general, differences between models are substantially larger than among the simulations in the CESM-LENS, indicating that the SST changes are more strongly affected by model formulation than internal climate variability. The annual SST trends over 1976–2099 in the 18 LMEs examined here are all positive ranging from 0.05 to 0.5°C decade–1. SST changes by the end of the 21st century are primarily due to a positive shift in the mean with only modest changes in the variability in most LMEs, resulting in a substantial increase in warm extremes and decrease in cold extremes. The shift in the mean is so large that in many regions SSTs during 2070–2099 will always be warmer than the warmest year during 1976–2005. The SST trends are generally stronger in summer than in winter, as greenhouse gas heating is integrated over a much shallower climatological mixed layer depth in summer than in winter, which amplifies the seasonal cycle of SST over the 21st century. In the Arctic, the mean SST and its variability increases substantially during summer, when it is ice free, but not during winter when a thin layer of ice reforms and SSTs remain near the freezing point.},

In the present study, we analyzed the influence of environmental conditions in the Sargasso Sea and Atlantic ocean circulation on European glass eel recruitment success. Over a recent 11-yr period, we showed a strong positive correlation between an original index of glass eel recruitment and primary production (PP) in eel spawning area. Moreover, PP was negatively correlated with temperature in the Sargasso Sea. Therefore, we used sea temperature as an inverse proxy of marine production. A close negative relationship has been found over the last four decades between long-term fluctuations in recruitment and in sea temperature. These findings were reinforced by the detection of a regime shift in sea temperature that preceded the start of the decline in glass eel recruitment in the early 1980s. By contrast, variations in integrative indices measuring ocean circulation, i.e. latitude and strength of the Gulf Stream, did not seem to explain variations in glass eel recruitment. Our results support the hypothesis of a strong bottom-up control of leptocephali survival and growth by PP in the Sargasso Sea on short and long time scales. We argue that sea warming in the eel spawning area since the early 1980s has modified marine production and eventually affected the survival rate of European eels at early life stages.},

Global warming is thought to affect phytoplankton production both directly, by impacting their photosynthetic metabolism, and indirectly by modifying the physical environment in which they grow. In this respect, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea (North Atlantic gyre) provides a unique opportunity to explore effects of warming on phytoplankton production across the vast oligotrophic ocean regions because it is one of the few multidecadal records of measured net primary productivity (NPP). We analysed the time series of phytoplankton primary productivity at BATS site using machine learning techniques (ML) to show that increased water temperature over a 27-year period (1990–2016), and the consequent weakening of vertical mixing in the upper ocean, induced a negative feedback on phytoplankton productivity by reducing the availability of essential resources, nitrogen and light. The unbalanced availability of these resources with warming, coupled with ecological changes at the community level, is expected to intensify the oligotrophic state of open-ocean regions that are far from land-based nutrient sources.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton are at the base of aquatic food webs and of global importance for ecosystem functioning and services. The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect  various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Changes in the North Atlantic component of global ocean overturning circulation, the AMO (Atlantic meridional overturning), were associated with abrupt climate change during the last ice age. It has been suggested that global warming could enhance freshwater discharge into the North Atlantic and shut down the AMO, causing significant cooling. These possible climate effects have attracted a lot of attention, but little thought has been given to what might happen to the marine ecosystem if the AMO were to weaken or disappear. Andreas Schmittner has performed a detailed simulation and finds that a collapse of the AMO would cut global productivity by about 20\%. The model results are consistent with the available records of past productivity. The decline in plankton stocks that would accompany changes of that scale could have a dramatic impact on fisheries in the affected areas.},

This study documents the subsurface biological response and the subsequent chlorophyll bloom observed in response to the tropical cyclone Hudhud as evident from a Bio-Argo float located at the central Bay of Bengal. Results show high chlorophyll concentrations of up to 4.5mgm−3 which is anomalous in the normally warm, stratified, and oligotrophic Bay of Bengal. The chlorophyll bloom is attributed to the combined effect of subsurface chlorophyll entrainment and nutrient injection. The presence of a pre-existing cyclonic eddy and the decreased translation speed of the cyclone over this region could have played a role in inducing the biological response. This is the first ever report to document the evolution of a subsurface chlorophyll bloom in response to cyclone forcing using Bio-Argo observations.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton biomass in the world's oceans amounts to only ∽1–2\% of the total global plant carbon, yet these organisms fix between 30 and 50 billion metric tons of carbon annually, which is about 40\% of the total. On geological time scales there is profound evidence of the importance of phytoplankton photosynthesis in biogeochemical cycles. It is generally assumed that present phytoplankton productivity is in a quasi steady-state (on the time scale of decades). However, in a global context, the stability of oceanic photosynthetic processes is dependent on the physical circulation of the upper ocean and is therefore strongly influenced by the atmosphere. The net flux of atmospheric radiation is critical to determining the depth of the upper mixed layer and the vertical fluxes of nutrients. These latter two parameters are keys to determining the intensity, and spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton blooms. Atmospheric radiation budgets are not in steady-state. Driven largely by anthropogenic activities in the 20th century, increased levels of IR- absorbing gases such as CO2, CH4 and CFC's and NOx will potentially increase atmospheric temperatures on a global scale. The atmospheric radiation budget can affect phytoplankton photosynthesis directly and indirectly. Increased temperature differences between the continents and oceans have been implicated in higher wind stresses at the ocean margins. Increased wind speeds can lead to higher nutrient fluxes. Throughout most of the central oceans, nitrate concentrations are sub-micromolar and there is strong evidence that the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II is impaired by nutrient stress. Higher nutrient fluxes would lead to both an increase in phytoplankton biomass and higher biomass-specific rates of carbon fixation. However, in the center of the ocean gyres, increased radiative heating could reduce the vertical flux of nutrients to the euphotic zone, and hence lead to a reduction in phytoplankton carbon fixation. Increased desertification in terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased aeolean loadings of essential micronutrients, such as iron. An increased flux of aeolean micronutrients could fertilize nutrient-replete areas of the open ocean with limiting trace elements, thereby stimulating photosynthetic rates. The factors which limit phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis are discussed and examined with regard to potential changes in the Earth climate system which can lead the oceans away from steady-state. While it is difficult to confidently deduce changes in either phytoplankton biomass or photosynthetic rates on decadal time scales, time-series analysis of ocean transparency data suggest long-term trends have occurred in the North Pacific Ocean in the 20th century. However, calculations of net carbon uptake by the oceans resulting from phytoplankton photosynthesis suggest that without a supply of nutrients external to the ocean, carbon fixation in the open ocean is not presently a significant sink for excess atmospheric CO2.},

Station S and Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Study (BATS), which are 60 km apart, both show that a multidecadal trend of deep warming has reversed, likely as a result of the increased production of Labrador Sea Water since the early 1980s. In addition to recording similar changes in watermass properties, the two time series show similar mean vertical structure and variance as a function of pressure for temperature, salinity, and density above 1500 dbar. The seasonal cycles of these water properties at the two sites are statistically indistinguishable. The time series differ in the individual eddy events they record and in their variability below 1500 dbar. The two time series are used to investigate the propagation of eddy features. Coherence and phase calculated from the low-mode variability of density show westward propagation at ϳ3 cm sϪ1 of wavelengths around 300–500 km. Satellite altimeter data are used to provide a broader spatial view of the eddy (or wave) field near Bermuda.},

Climate change reduces land and ocean uptake of CO2, respectively by 54\% and 35\% at 4 ? CO2. This negative impact implies that for prescribed anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the atmospheric CO2 would be higher than the level reached if climate change does not affect the carbon cycle. We estimate the gain of this climate-carbon cycle feedback to be 10\% at 2 ? CO2 and 20\% at 4 ? CO2. This translates into a 15\% higher mean temperature increase.},
