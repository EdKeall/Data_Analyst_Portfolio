This project encompasses my Dissertation on the 'Trends in subsurface phytoplankton Biomass at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study'.

I focused on this work from September 2021 to March 2022.

This project was my entire introduction to Data Analysis in Python, having to learn the language from scratch along with many of the processes I had to use.

Files:
- 'thousand_m_BATS.csv' (267MB) - The first dataset containing 30 years of high freqeuncy CTD (Conductivity/Temperature/Depth) readings Data taken at a survey site in Bermuda. Temperature, Depth, Time, Cruise_ID and fluorescence (to estimate phytoplankton biomass) were the key values I needed to isolate and work with for this project. (due to this file's size, I've uploaded a reduced 95KB file). Sourced from simonscmap.com: https://simonscmap.com/catalog/datasets/BATS%20CTD

- 'BATS_pigment.csv' (532KB) - The second dataset contains 30 years of low freqeuncy/high accuracy Bottle sample data (lab-analysed seawater samples) taken from the same survey site in Bermuda. Depth, Time, Cruise_ID and two measures of Chl-a (pigment14 & pigment 16) were needed for this project. Sourced from simonscmap.com: https://simonscmap.com/catalog/datasets/BATS%20Pigments

- 'Data_Crunching_and_Analysis.ipynb' (1991KB) - Jupyter Notebook containing all the coding of this project in Python. Each section's function is described concisely above it.

- 'Dissertation Writeup.pdf' - Final Report of my results and findings, provides a lot of context to the project.

- 'Dissertation Writeup Latex files' - Code and files used to create the 'Dissertation Writeup.pdf' in LaTeX.

Skills involved (all using Python):
1. Data Collection (online sourcing)
2. Data Cleansing
3. Applying Corrections to Data
4. Modelling of Physical Data and Calibrating alternate data to it
5. Data Transformation
6. Applying data to a complex model
7. Trapizial Integration
8. Linear Regression
9. Data Visualisation (matplotlib_pyplt, incl. Contour plots)
10. Code Report Writing (Jupyter Notebook)

Further step by step details of my methods and techiques are available in the 'Data_Crunching_and_Analysis.ipynb' and 'Dissertation_writeup.pdf'.
