# Data_Analyst_Portfolio
This repository is mainly for the data analysis related projects I have done under the University of Exeter Marine Biology BSc and future projects I hope to engage in to improve my skills.

## Projects:

March 2022 - Dissertation Project: Covers the largest project I have completed to date. Written in Python using Jupyter Notebook, here I sourced, crunched, modelled and analysed two large longitudinal datasets from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS)


Further details of each project can be found in each project folder.
