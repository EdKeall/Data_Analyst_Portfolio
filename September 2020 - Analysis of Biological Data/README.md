This repository is for the R code I wrote during the 1st term of my second year for my University of Exeter Marine Biology BSc. 


## Projects:

<ol>
  <li> <b>Assignment 3</b> </li>
    <ol>
      <li>First ANOVA techniques are used to assess the effects of different variables on hatchling weight in Gannet colonies</li>
      <li>A model is produced that can predict hatchling weight based on parent weight and the island it was born on</li>
      <li>ANCOVA techniques are then used to control for the interaction between variables</li>
