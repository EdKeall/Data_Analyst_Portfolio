	abstract = {The phenomenon of subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs) is not a unique ecological response to environmental conditions; rather, a broad range of interacting processes can contribute to the formation of persistent layers of elevated chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) that are nearly ubiquitous in stratiﬁed surface waters. Mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the SCMLs include a local maximum in phytoplankton growth rate near the nutricline, photoacclimation of pigment content that leads to elevated Chl relative to phytoplankton biomass at depth, and a range of physiologically inﬂuenced swimming behaviors in motile phytoplankton and buoyancy control in diatoms and cyanobacteria that can lead to aggregations of phytoplankton in layers, subject to grazing and physical control. A postulated typical stable water structure characterizes consistent patterns in vertical proﬁles of Chl, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and light across a trophic gradient structured by the vertical ﬂux of nutrients and characterized by the average daily irradiance at the nutricline. Hypothetical predictions can be tested using a nascent biogeochemical global ocean observing system. Partial results to date are generally consistent with predictions based on current knowledge, which has strong roots in research from the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {Stratified oceanic systems are characterized by the presence of a so-called Deep Chlorophyll a Maximum (DCM) not detectable by ocean color satellites. A DCM can either be a phytoplankton (carbon) biomass maximum (Deep Biomass Maximum, DBM), or the consequence of photoacclimation processes (Deep photoAcclimation Maximum, DAM) resulting in the increase of chlorophyll a per phytoplankton carbon. Even though these DCM (further qualified as either DBMs or DAMs) have long been studied, no global-scale assessment has yet been undertaken and large knowledge gaps still remain in relation to the environmental drivers responsible for their formation and maintenance. In order to investigate their spatial and temporal variability in the open ocean, we use a global data set acquired by more than 500 Biogeochemical-Argo floats given that DCMs can be detected from the comparative vertical distribution of chlorophyll a concentrations and particulate backscattering coefficients. Our findings show that the seasonal dynamics of the DCMs are clearly region-dependent. High-latitude environments are characterized by a low occurrence of intense DBMs, restricted to summer. Meanwhile, oligotrophic regions host permanent DAMs, occasionally replaced by DBMs in summer, while subequatorial waters are characterized by permanent DBMs benefiting from favorable conditions in terms of both light and nutrients. Overall, the appearance and depth of DCMs are primarily driven by light attenuation in the upper layer. Our present assessment of DCM occurrence and of environmental conditions prevailing in their development lay the basis for a better understanding and quantification of their role in carbon budgets (primary production and export).},

This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean–atmosphere CO2 exchange2. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels3 causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry4. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae5,6, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica . This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.},

	abstract = {The northwestern Mediterranean Sea (NWMS) is biologically one of the most productive Mediterranean regions. NWMS pelagic planktonic ecosystem is strongly influenced by hydrodynamics, in particular by deep convection that could significantly weaken under the influence of climate change. Here we investigate the response of this ecosystem and associated carbon cycle to the long-term evolution of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. For that we developed a tridimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model and performed two groups of annual simulations under the climate conditions of respectively the 20th and the end of 21st centuries. Our results suggest that the evolution of oceanic and atmospheric circulations does not modify the NWMS pelagic planktonic ecosystem and associated carbon cycle at a first order. However, differences mainly induced by the deep convection weakening and the surface warming are obtained at a second order. The spring bloom occurs 1 month earlier. Resulting from the decrease in nutrients availability, the bottom up control of phytoplankton development and bacteria growth by the nitrogen and phosphorus availability strengthens and the microbial loop intensifies as the small-sized plankton biomass increases. Carbon net fixation and deep export do not change significantly. The choice of the biogeochemical initial and boundary conditions does not change the representation of the ecosystem seasonal cycle, but the associated uncertainty range can be one order of magnitude larger than the predicted interannual and long-term variabilities. The uncertainty range of long-term trends associated with the physical forcing (hydrological, atmospheric, hydrodynamical, and socioeconomic) is much smaller ({\textless}10\%).},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The vertical separation of organic matter formation from respiration can lead to net carbon sequestration within the ocean’s interior, making the biological pump an important component of the global carbon cycle. Understanding the response of the biological pump to the changing environment is a prerequisite to predicting future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Will the biological pump weaken or strengthen? Currently the ocean science community is unable to confidently answer this question. Carbon flux at approximately 1000 m depth, the sequestration flux, determines the removal of carbon from the atmosphere on time scales ≥100 yr. The sequestration flux depends upon: (1) input rates of nutrients allochthonous to the ocean, (2) the export flux at the base of the euphotic zone, (3) the deviation of carbon fixation and remineralization from Redfield stoichiometry, and (4) the flux attenuation in the upper 1000 m. The biological response to increasing temperature, ocean stratification, nutrient availability and ocean acidification is frequently taxa- and ecosystem-specific and the results of synergistic effects are challenging to predict. Consequently, the use of global averages and steady state assumptions (e.g. Redfield stoichiometry, mesopelagic nutrient inventory) for predictive models is often insufficient. Our ability to predict sequestration flux additionally suffers from a lack of understanding of mesopelagic food web functioning and flux attenuation. However, regional specific investigations show great promise, suggesting that in the near future predictions of changes to the biological pump will have to be regionally and ecosystem specific, with the ultimate goal of integrating to global scales.},

	abstract = {Established conceptual models of the initiation and progression of spring phytoplankton blooms are reconsidered in light of recent observations. We use biological simulation modelling as a tool for the analysis of spring plankton blooms in shallow, coastal waters in temperate latitudes of the North Atlantic. The model shows that interannual variability in the timing of bloom initiation arises from year-to-year differences in incident irradiation, as determined by weather (cloudiness). This variability in timing results in some years when the spring bloom occurs in cold water temperatures near 0°C. Model results suggest that due to low temperature inhibition of heterotrophic consumption, more fresh organic material is delivered to the benthos in these cold-water blooms than when the bloom occurs in waters only 3°C warmer. Thus we suggest that variable bloom timing can be important to the trophodynamic fate of bloom products. We suggest that variability in timing of spring phytoplankton blooms in offshore and open ocean waters is also related to weather, through controls on the light field and wind mixing. Our analyses of wind-driven vertical mixing demonstrate such blooms can begin following the winter period of deep convection, and prior to the vernal development of stratification, provided that wind speed is below a certain, predictable threshold, which we estimate. In such cases, there may be several spring bloom pulses, each interrupted by self-shading light limitation or vertical mixing events. Eventually the seasonal thermocline develops and nutrient exhaustion curtails bloom production. This means that the spring phytoplankton bloom in offshore and open ocean areas may be significantly more productive, result in more export production, and be more important to the carbon cycle, than has been previously assumed. Furthermore, these features of temperate marine planktonic ecosystems are not only sensitive to annual variations in weather, but also any trends that might result from greenhouse warming or other factors that affect the climate system.},

	abstract = {Increased nutrient delivery to estuarine systems results in elevated growth of primary producers. This is evidenced by high chlorophyll concentrations and increased frequency of phytoplankton blooms. However, shifts in nutrient loads to estuarine ecosystems can also cause modifications in the structure of phytoplankton communities which can have adverse impacts right through the food web. Acknowledging these modifications is imperative if response mechanisms are to be fully understood. In this study, Ireland’s current water framework directive (WFD) tool for determining the status of phytoplankton communities was built upon to encompass not only biomass and bloom frequency but also community structure (diversity and evenness) and abundance. This method allows for comparison with site- and date-specific environmental data which could give an indication of cause and effect relationships. The newly developed phytoplankton index performed well against current methods to determine ecological status. Furthermore, it had a better agreement with other physico-chemical and biological WFD parameters. Statistical analysis captured the relationship between the phytoplankton index and physico-chemical parameters, allowing for a more detailed look at the impact of disturbance on the system. The inclusion of community structure acknowledged the imbalances in the phytoplankton communities of some systems even when frequent blooms are not evident. In bloom conditions, the disparity between the chlorophyll and abundance metrics within the phytoplankton index can be linked to winter dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentra- tion and forms, temperature, and light conditions. Application of the phytoplankton index will allow not only for compliance with WFD requirements, but also a method for understanding and assessing ecosystem health of estuarine phytoplankton communities over spatial and temporal timelines in line with changes in physiochemical parameters.},

The timing of the spring bloom shows only little response to warming as such, while light appears to play a more important role in its initiation. The daily light dose needed for the start of the phytoplankton spring bloom in our experiments agrees well with a recently published critical light intensity found in a field survey of the North Atlantic (around 1.3?mol?photons?m?2?day?1). Experimental temperature elevation had a strong effect on phytoplankton peak biomass (decreasing with temperature), mean cell size (decreasing with temperature) and on the share of microplankton diatoms (decreasing with temperature). All these changes will lead to poorer feeding conditions for copepod zooplankton and, thus, to a less efficient energy transfer from primary to fish production under a warmer climate.},

Environmental processes that control the phenology of blooms, such as stratification, may differ from those that influence fish spawning, such as temperature-linked reproductive maturation. These different controlling mechanisms could cause the timing of these events to diverge under climate change with negative consequences for fisheries. We use an earth system model to examine the impact of a high-emissions, climate-warming scenario (RCP8.5) on the future spawning time of two classes of temperate, epipelagic fishes: ?geographic spawners? whose spawning grounds are defined by fixed geographic features (e.g., rivers, estuaries, reefs) and ?environmental spawners? whose spawning grounds move responding to variations in environmental properties, such as temperature. By the century's end, our results indicate that projections of increased stratification cause spring and summer phytoplankton blooms to start 16 days earlier on average (±0.05 days SE) at latitudes {\textgreater}40°N. The temperature-linked phenology of geographic spawners changes at a rate twice as fast as phytoplankton, causing these fishes to spawn before the bloom starts across {\textgreater}85\% of this region. ?Extreme events,? defined here as seasonal mismatches {\textgreater}30 days that could lead to fish recruitment failure, increase 10-fold for geographic spawners in many areas under the RCP8.5 scenario. Mismatches between environmental spawners and phytoplankton were smaller and less widespread, although sizable mismatches still emerged in some regions. This indicates that range shifts undertaken by environmental spawners may increase the resiliency of fishes to climate change impacts associated with phenological mismatches, potentially buffering against declines in larval fish survival, recruitment, and fisheries. Our model results are supported by empirical evidence from ecosystems with multidecadal observations of both fish and phytoplankton phenology.},

	abstract = {The seasonal phytoplankton biomass distribution pattern in stratified temperate marine waters is traditionally depicted as consisting of spring and autumn blooms. The energy source supporting pelagic summer production is believed to be the spring bloom. However, the spring bloom disappears relatively quickly from the water column and a large proportion of the material sedimenting to the bottom following the spring bloom is often comprised of intact phytoplankton cells. Thus, it is easy to argue that the spring bloom is fueling the energy demands of the benthos, but more difficult to argue convincingly that energy fixed during the spring bloom is fueling the pelagic production occurring during summer months. We argue here that periodic phytoplankton blooms are occurring during the summer in the North Sea at depths of \&gt;25 m and that the accumulated new production [sensu (Dugdale and Goering, Limnol. Oceanogr., 12, 196–206, 1967)] occurring in these blooms may be greater than that occurring in the spring bloom in the same regions. Thus, such blooms may explain apparent discrepancies in production yields between different temperate marine systems.},

Phytoplankton are at the base of most marine food webs and play an important role in drawing CO2 out of the atmosphere. Using nearly 5years of simultaneous CTD, irradiance, chlorophyll a fluorescence and optical backscattering observations obtained from Slocum glider missions, we observed the subsurface phytoplankton populations across the Scotian Shelf, near Halifax (Nova Scotia, Canada) along with their physical environment. Bloom conditions were observed in each of the 5 springs, with the average chlorophyll in the upper 60m of water generally exceeding 3mgm−3. These blooms occurred when the upper water column stratification was at its lowest, in apparent contradiction of the critical depth hypothesis. A subsurface chlorophyll layer was observed each summer at about 30m depth, which was below the base of the mixed layer. This subsurface layer lasted 3–4months and contained, on average, 1/4 of the integrated water column chlorophyll found during the spring bloom. This suggests that a significant portion of the primary productivity over the Scotian Shelf occurs at depths that cannot be observed by satellites—highlighting the importance of including subsurface observations in the monitoring of future changes to primary productivity in the ocean.},

Mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of the SCMLs include a local maximum in phytoplankton growth rate near the nutricline, photoacclimation of pigment content that leads to elevated Chl relative to phytoplankton biomass at depth, and a range of physiologically influenced swimming behaviors in motile phytoplankton and buoyancy control in diatoms and cyanobacteria that can lead to aggregations of phytoplankton in layers, subject to grazing and physical control. A postulated typical stable water structure characterizes consistent patterns in vertical profiles of Chl, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, and light across a trophic gradient structured by the vertical flux of nutrients and characterized by the average daily irradiance at the nutricline. Hypothetical predictions can be tested using a nascent biogeochemical global ocean observing system. Partial results to date are generally consistent with predictions based on current knowledge, which has strong roots in research from the twentieth century.},

We measured size-fractionated pigments and environmental variables on the western Arctic shelf during the open-water season in 2014, to study the spatial pattern and mechanisms of the phytoplankton community at the SCM. The SCM layers accumulated approximately 50\% of the chlorophyll a (Chl a) standing stock in the water column, and the contribution increased to {\textgreater}70\% for high-biomass areas, suggesting the biological importance of the summer SCM in the shelf ecosystem. The spatial difference in phytoplankton biomass was caused mainly by bioavailable nitrogen concentrations, and the spatial difference in diatom size may be the result of differences in predominant species. High biomass and large diatoms dominated in the SCM layers, making the south and north of the Chukchi shelf a biological hotspot for the ecosystem's food chain and benthos of the western Arctic shelf in summer.},

	abstract = {The vertical distribution of phytoplankton cells and chlorophyll concentrations throughout the sunlit water column is rarely uniform. In many ocean regions, chlorophyll concentrations peak in distinct and persistent layers deep below the surface called subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs). SCML formation is hypothesized to reflect the consequences of phytoplankton light/macronutrient colimitation, behavior, and/or photoacclimation. We discovered unexpectedly persistent and widespread phytoplankton iron limitation and iron/light colimitation in SCMLs of the California Current and at the edge of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre using shipboard incubations, metatranscriptomics, and biogeochemical proxies. These results suggest that interactions and feedbacks between iron and light availability play an important and previously unrecognized role in controlling the productivity and biogeochemical dynamics of SCMLs.Subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers (SCMLs) are nearly ubiquitous in stratified water columns and exist at horizontal scales ranging from the submesoscale to the extent of oligotrophic gyres. These layers of heightened chlorophyll and/or phytoplankton concentrations are generally thought to be a consequence of a balance between light energy from above and a limiting nutrient flux from below, typically nitrate (NO3). Here we present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that iron (Fe) limits or with light colimits phytoplankton communities in SCMLs along a primary productivity gradient from coastal to oligotrophic offshore waters in the southern California Current ecosystem. SCML phytoplankton responded markedly to added Fe or Fe/light in experimental incubations and transcripts of diatom and picoeukaryote Fe stress genes were strikingly abundant in SCML metatranscriptomes. Using a biogeochemical proxy with data from a 40-y time series, we find that diatoms growing in California Current SCMLs are persistently Fe deficient during the spring and summer growing season. We also find that the spatial extent of Fe deficiency within California Current SCMLs has significantly increased over the last 25 y in line with a regional climate index. Finally, we show that diatom Fe deficiency may be common in the subsurface of major upwelling zones worldwide. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the biogeochemical consequences of marine SCML formation and maintenance.},

	abstract = {Models used to predict future ocean ecosystem and biogeochemical behaviour depend on simplified ecological frameworks allowing the definition of plankton functional types. Foremost among such frameworks has been the mandala of Margalef. His 1978 paper has been increasingly referred to in the past decade as simplified ecological schemes have been sought to help predict the effect of climate change on phytoplankton. However, the mandala is based on an understanding of the subject that is over 40 years old, when observational studies were largely limited to the coastal ocean and to near surface waters. Furthermore, most recent reproductions of the mandala are significant oversimplifications of Margalef’s original. In these simplified mandala-type constructs, diatoms, in particular, have commonly been cast as a single plankton functional type that thrive in turbulent waters and decrease in abundance with increasing stratification. On this basis, it is widely predicted that diatom productivity and hence the effectiveness of the marine biological carbon pump will decrease with climate change that is driving increased stratification of the oceans. But Margalef’s original took a more refined approach and depicted diatom genera that were adapted to more stratified conditions such as those characteristic of the subtropical oligotrophic gyres. If we now draw on the vast advances in observational oceanography of recent decades it is evident that diatoms may thrive, bloom and generate significant export even in the most intensely stratified and apparently oligotrophic conditions. Indeed, some diatom species have unique adaptations to such environments. We therefore suggest that it is time to abandon oversimplified schemes and recognize the diverse ecology of diatoms.},

Vertical profiles from different regions of the sea are presented; each has a deep chlorophyll maximum, but the probable mechanisms of their formation and maintenance differ widely. Most vertical distributions of chlorophyll can be explained by the interaction between hydrography and growth, behavior, or physiological adaptation of phytoplankton with no special consideration of grazing by herbivores, even though vertical distributions of epizooplankton are not uniform.

	abstract = {Marine primary production influences the transfer of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere, and the availability of energy for the pelagic food web. Both the rate and the fate of organic carbon from primary production are dependent on phytoplankton size. A key aim of the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) programme has been to quantify biological carbon cycling in the Atlantic Ocean and measurements of total primary production have been routinely made on AMT cruises, as well as additional measurements of size-fractionated primary production on some cruises. Measurements of total primary production collected on the AMT have been used to evaluate remote-sensing techniques capable of producing basin-scale estimates of primary production. Though models exist to estimate size-fractionated primary production from satellite data, these have not been well validated in the Atlantic Ocean, and have been parameterised using measurements of phytoplankton pigments rather than direct measurements of phytoplankton size structure. Here, we re-tune a remote-sensing primary production model to estimate production in three size fractions of phytoplankton ({\textless}2μm, 2–10μm and {\textgreater}10μm) in the Atlantic Ocean, using measurements of size-fractionated chlorophyll and size-fractionated photosynthesis-irradiance experiments conducted on AMT 22 and 23 using sequential filtration-based methods. The performance of the remote-sensing technique was evaluated using: (i) independent estimates of size-fractionated primary production collected on a number of AMT cruises using 14C on-deck incubation experiments and (ii) Monte Carlo simulations. Considering uncertainty in the satellite inputs and model parameters, we estimate an average model error of between 0.27 and 0.63 for log10-transformed size-fractionated production, with lower errors for the small size class ({\textless}2μm), higher errors for the larger size classes (2–10μm and {\textgreater}10μm), and errors generally higher in oligotrophic waters. Application to satellite data in 2007 suggests the contribution of cells {\textless}2μm and {\textgreater}2μm to total primary production is approximately equal in the Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {During its lifetime, a space-borne ocean color sensor provides world-wide information about important biogeochemical properties of the upper ocean every 2 to 4 days in cloudless regions. Merging simultaneous or complementary data from such sensors to obtain better spatial and temporal coverage is a recurring objective, but it can only be reached if the consistency of the sensor-specific products, as delivered by the various Space Agencies, has first been carefully examined. The goal of the present study is to provide a procedure for establishing a coherency of open ocean (Case-1 waters) data products, for which the various data processing methods are sufficiently similar. The development of the procedure includes a detailed comparison of the marine algorithms used (after atmospheric corrections) by space agencies for the production of standard products, such as the chlorophyll concentration, [Chl], and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd. The MODIS-Aqua, SeaWiFS and MERIS [Chl] products agree over a wide range, between ∼0.1 and 3 mg m−3, whereas increasing divergences occur for oligotrophic waters ([Chl] (from 0.02 to 0.09 mg m−3). For the Kd(490) coefficient, different algorithms are in use, with differing results. Based on a semi-analytical reflectance model and hyperspectral approach, the present work proposes a harmonization of the algorithms allowing the products of the various sensors to be comparable, and ultimately, meaningfully merged (the merging procedures themselves are not examined). Additional potential products, obtained by using [Chl] as an intermediate tool, are also examined and proposed. These products include the thickness of the layer heated by the sun, the depth of the euphotic zone, and the Secchi disk depth. The physical limitations in the predictive skill of such downward extrapolations, made from information concerning only the upper layer, are stressed.},

Calculating the surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2sw) from float pH has uncertainty contributions from the pH sensor, the alkalinity estimate, and carbonate system equilibrium constants, resulting in a relative standard uncertainty in pCO2sw of 2.7\% (or 11?µatm at pCO2sw of 400?µatm). The calculated pCO2sw from several floats spanning a range of oceanographic regimes are compared to existing climatologies. In some locations, such as the subantarctic zone, the float data closely match the climatologies, but in the polar Antarctic zone significantly higher pCO2sw are calculated in the wintertime implying a greater air-sea CO2 efflux estimate. Our results based on four representative floats suggest that despite their uncertainty relative to direct measurements, the float data can be used to improve estimates for air-sea carbon flux, as well as to increase knowledge of spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability in this flux.},

Seasonality and interannual dynamics of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and small eukaryotic algae ({\textless}12μm diameter) abundance, cellular carbon content (QC; particulate organic carbon; POC cell−1), and group-specific carbon biomass are reported. QC of individual taxa varied with depth and season by as much as an order of magnitude, roughly comparable to variability in abundance. During the time-series there were obvious shifts in the taxonomic distribution of photosynthetic carbon biomass; these interannual shifts in biomass were due to simultaneous changes in both QC and cell abundance. The observed pattern was not apparent from numerical abundance alone, highlighting the importance of QC measurements in place of using fixed conversion factors to better understand biological carbon dynamics. Changes in the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from positive to negative modes correlated with shifts in biomass between picocyanobacteria and small eukaryotic algae, respectively. Thus, shifts in algal community structure are inferred to be associated with changes in light intensity and implied nutrient supply via mixing (i.e., patterns in upper ocean stability). These observed changes in phytoplankton biomass partitioning were correlated with the important ocean carbon cycle parameters of export flux, mesopelagic transfer efficiency, and elemental stoichiometry. Importantly, interannual relationships between these parameters and algal biomass were detected only when QC was considered as variable.},

	abstract = {Chlorophyll a preserved in lake sediments reflects, in part, past primary production. This study assesses the spectral properties of sedimentary chlorophyll a using visible-near infrared reflectance (VNIR) spectroscopy, with the objective of establishing a new, non-destructive paleolimnological proxy. Reflectance spectra were determined from a dilution series (n = 10) involving incremental additions of pulverized modern algae to a lake sediment matrix of low organic content. This enabled an assessment of the development of sediment reflectance spectra in relation to different sediment chlorophyll a concentrations, and subsequent regression of spectral features against measured concentrations of chlorophyll a and derivatives obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The experiment demonstrates that ubiquitous troughs in sediment reflectance near 675 nm are attributable to chlorophyll a and derivative compounds. A significant correlation (r2 = 0.98, P {\textless} 0.01) was obtained between the area of the reflectance trough in the 650–700 nm interval and summed concentrations of chlorophyll a, all derivative isomers, and degradational pheopigments. A simple linear inference model derived from this experiment was applied to a down-core sequence of VNIR spectra from a productive prairie lake (Alberta, Canada), where it produced inferred sediment chlorophyll a concentrations in concordance with HPLC measurements. Although a larger training set is desirable to further refine the inference model, the analyses reported here demonstrate that reflectance spectroscopy provides a rapid, semi-quantitative method for assessing the chlorophyll a content of lake sediments.},

	abstract = {Marine diatoms as indicators of modern environment change A substantial part of the ocean’s primary productivity is provided by diatoms (Tréguer et al., 1995). In general, they are the dominant primary producers in temperate and cold areas, and are very abundant in the recently upwelled waters of Eastern Boundary Currents and in diverging surface currents where nutrients are brought to the surface (Nelson et al., 1995, and references therein). On an annual basis, the relative contribution of diatoms to primary productivity is highly variable: Nelson et al. (1995) and Tréguer et al. (1995) proposed upper limits of 35\% in oligotrophic areas and up to 75\% in coastal upwelling areas and other nutrient-rich systems. Regardless of the area, the general trend is for an increase in the relative abundance of diatoms in the phytoplankton together with primary productivity (Ragueneau et al., 2000). As a general statement we may say that diatoms are the dominant primary producers in a number of oceanographic settings that offer both the required high-nutrient and turbulence conditions (e.g. coastal upwelling areas, equatorial divergences, ice-edges, river plumes; Ragueneau et al., 2000). In contrast, small, non-siliceous pico- and nanoplankton are of great importance to total productivity in oligotrophic regions (Tréguer et al., 1995, and references therein).},

	abstract = {Over timescales of months to years, the export of organic nitrogen from the oceanic euphotic zone (principally as sinking particulate nitrogen, PN) is believed to balance the input of exogenous combined inorganic nitrogen (i.e., export production balances new production). In the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre, there are two significant sources of new nitrogen: the upward flux of nitrate from deep water and the biological fixation of dissolved N2 in near-surface waters. Because these sources have distinct stable isotopic signatures, we were able to use the total PN and ?15N measurements of sinking particles and an isotopic mass balance model to deconvolute the relative and absolute contributions of the nitrate flux and nitrogen fixation to the gravitational export of PN. The sinking flux of PN and its isotopic composition both varied widely between 1989 and 2001. Seasonally, N2 fixation correlated inversely with mixed-layer depth, reaching a maximum in June-August, whereas nitrate-supported export correlated inversely with sea surface temperature, reaching a maximum in February-March. These patterns were consistent with summertime increases in diazotroph biomass and water column N2 fixation rates, as indicated by phycoerythrin pigment concentrations and 15N2 tracer studies. Annually, the relative contribution of N2 fixation to N export varied from 36 to 69\% (mean = 48\%) and showed a significant increasing trend over the period of observation. Although total PN export correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index, the nitrate- and nitrogen fixation-based components appeared to respond to climate forcing in distinct ways, complicating our interpretation of the mechanisms of climate-induced changes in particle export.},

Specifically, skill was assessed based on the models' ability to estimate the observed mean, variability, and trends of NPP. At both sites, more than 90\% of the models underestimated mean NPP, with the average bias of the BOGCMs being nearly twice that of the ocean color models. However, the difference in overall skill between the best BOGCM and the best ocean color model at each site was not significant. Between 1989 and 2007, in situ NPP at BATS and HOT increased by an average of nearly 2\% per year and was positively correlated to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. The majority of ocean color models produced in situ NPP trends that were closer to the observed trends when chlorophyll-a was derived from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), rather than fluorometric or SeaWiFS data. However, this was a function of time such that average trend magnitude was more accurately estimated over longer time periods. Among BOGCMs, only two individual models successfully produced an increasing NPP trend (one model at each site). We caution against the use of models to assess multiannual changes in NPP over short time periods. Ocean color model estimates of NPP trends could improve if more high quality HPLC chlorophyll-a time series were available.},

	abstract = {Global climate models were used to assess changes in the mean, variability and extreme sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in northern oceans with a focus on large marine ecosystems (LMEs) adjacent to North America, Europe, and the Arctic Ocean. Results were obtained from 26 models in the Community Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive and 30 simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Large Ensemble Community Project (CESM-LENS). All of the simulations used the observed greenhouse gas concentrations for 1976–2005 and the RCP8.5 “business as usual” scenario for greenhouse gases through the remainder of the 21st century. In general, differences between models are substantially larger than among the simulations in the CESM-LENS, indicating that the SST changes are more strongly affected by model formulation than internal climate variability. The annual SST trends over 1976–2099 in the 18 LMEs examined here are all positive ranging from 0.05 to 0.5°C decade–1. SST changes by the end of the 21st century are primarily due to a positive shift in the mean with only modest changes in the variability in most LMEs, resulting in a substantial increase in warm extremes and decrease in cold extremes. The shift in the mean is so large that in many regions SSTs during 2070–2099 will always be warmer than the warmest year during 1976–2005. The SST trends are generally stronger in summer than in winter, as greenhouse gas heating is integrated over a much shallower climatological mixed layer depth in summer than in winter, which amplifies the seasonal cycle of SST over the 21st century. In the Arctic, the mean SST and its variability increases substantially during summer, when it is ice free, but not during winter when a thin layer of ice reforms and SSTs remain near the freezing point.},

In this respect, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea (North Atlantic gyre) provides a unique opportunity to explore effects of warming on phytoplankton production across the vast oligotrophic ocean regions because it is one of the few multidecadal records of measured net primary productivity (NPP). We analysed the time series of phytoplankton primary productivity at BATS site using machine learning techniques (ML) to show that increased water temperature over a 27-year period (1990–2016), and the consequent weakening of vertical mixing in the upper ocean, induced a negative feedback on phytoplankton productivity by reducing the availability of essential resources, nitrogen and light. The unbalanced availability of these resources with warming, coupled with ecological changes at the community level, is expected to intensify the oligotrophic state of open-ocean regions that are far from land-based nutrient sources.},

The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect  various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

These possible climate effects have attracted a lot of attention, but little thought has been given to what might happen to the marine ecosystem if the AMO were to weaken or disappear. Andreas Schmittner has performed a detailed simulation and finds that a collapse of the AMO would cut global productivity by about 20\%.

	abstract = {Phytoplankton biomass in the world's oceans amounts to only ∽1–2\% of the total global plant carbon, yet these organisms fix between 30 and 50 billion metric tons of carbon annually, which is about 40\% of the total. On geological time scales there is profound evidence of the importance of phytoplankton photosynthesis in biogeochemical cycles. It is generally assumed that present phytoplankton productivity is in a quasi steady-state (on the time scale of decades). However, in a global context, the stability of oceanic photosynthetic processes is dependent on the physical circulation of the upper ocean and is therefore strongly influenced by the atmosphere. The net flux of atmospheric radiation is critical to determining the depth of the upper mixed layer and the vertical fluxes of nutrients. These latter two parameters are keys to determining the intensity, and spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton blooms. Atmospheric radiation budgets are not in steady-state. Driven largely by anthropogenic activities in the 20th century, increased levels of IR- absorbing gases such as CO2, CH4 and CFC's and NOx will potentially increase atmospheric temperatures on a global scale. The atmospheric radiation budget can affect phytoplankton photosynthesis directly and indirectly. Increased temperature differences between the continents and oceans have been implicated in higher wind stresses at the ocean margins. Increased wind speeds can lead to higher nutrient fluxes. Throughout most of the central oceans, nitrate concentrations are sub-micromolar and there is strong evidence that the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II is impaired by nutrient stress. Higher nutrient fluxes would lead to both an increase in phytoplankton biomass and higher biomass-specific rates of carbon fixation. However, in the center of the ocean gyres, increased radiative heating could reduce the vertical flux of nutrients to the euphotic zone, and hence lead to a reduction in phytoplankton carbon fixation. Increased desertification in terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased aeolean loadings of essential micronutrients, such as iron. An increased flux of aeolean micronutrients could fertilize nutrient-replete areas of the open ocean with limiting trace elements, thereby stimulating photosynthetic rates. The factors which limit phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis are discussed and examined with regard to potential changes in the Earth climate system which can lead the oceans away from steady-state. While it is difficult to confidently deduce changes in either phytoplankton biomass or photosynthetic rates on decadal time scales, time-series analysis of ocean transparency data suggest long-term trends have occurred in the North Pacific Ocean in the 20th century. However, calculations of net carbon uptake by the oceans resulting from phytoplankton photosynthesis suggest that without a supply of nutrients external to the ocean, carbon fixation in the open ocean is not presently a significant sink for excess atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the oceanic variability at Bermuda between 1989 and 1999, recorded in two overlapping hydrographic time series. Station S and Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Study (BATS), which are 60 km apart, both show that a multidecadal trend of deep warming has reversed, likely as a result of the increased production of Labrador Sea Water since the early 1980s. In addition to recording similar changes in watermass properties, the two time series show similar mean vertical structure and variance as a function of pressure for temperature, salinity, and density above 1500 dbar. The seasonal cycles of these water properties at the two sites are statistically indistinguishable. The time series differ in the individual eddy events they record and in their variability below 1500 dbar. The two time series are used to investigate the propagation of eddy features. Coherence and phase calculated from the low-mode variability of density show westward propagation at ϳ3 cm sϪ1 of wavelengths around 300–500 km. Satellite altimeter data are used to provide a broader spatial view of the eddy (or wave) field near Bermuda.},

	abstract = {Future climate change due to increased atmospheric CO2 may affect land and ocean efficiency to absorb atmospheric CO2. Here, using climate and carbon three-dimensional models forced by a 1\% per year increase in atmospheric CO2, we show that there is a positive feedback between the climate system and the carbon cycle. Climate change reduces land and ocean uptake of CO2, respectively by 54\% and 35\% at 4 ? CO2. This negative impact implies that for prescribed anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the atmospheric CO2 would be higher than the level reached if climate change does not affect the carbon cycle. We estimate the gain of this climate-carbon cycle feedback to be 10\% at 2 ? CO2 and 20\% at 4 ? CO2. This translates into a 15\% higher mean temperature increase.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies play several key roles in the Southern Ocean by redistributing momentum, potential vorticity, heat and salt. However, the role of eddies in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry has received less attention. Previous studies have been based on satellites or models. In this study, Southern Ocean eddies were matched with BGC-Argo float profiles to investigate the subsurface biological structure of Southern Ocean eddies. We focused on four frontal regions in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean where data density is greater than in the other basins. The seasonality and regional variability of subsurface chlorophyll and backscatter structures were revealed by calculating anomalies in eddies relative to outside of eddies, in each season and frontal region. Chlorophyll anomalies in the mixed layer were mostly positive for both cyclones and anticyclones in all regions in spring, summer and autumn. Anomalies in winter were close to zero. Eddy pumping was the most likely mechanism sustaining high chlorophyll in cyclones. Eddy-induced Ekman pumping, in combination with deep vertical mixing was likely the driver of enhanced chlorophyll in anticyclones. Backscatter anomalies were mostly consistent with chlorophyll anomalies. Chlorophyll to backscatter ratios (chlorophyll:bbp) were also calculated to help understand the role of light acclimation in the phytoplankton. There were strong subsurface maxima for in-eddy chlorophyll:bbp in spring and summer. Such structures were weak in autumn and winter, but chlorophyll:bbp in the upper 30 m in autumn and winter was mostly higher than spring and summer in the same region. Photo-acclimation to low light at depth was evident for both cyclones and anticyclones in spring and summer in the euphotic zone, while in autumn and winter it was observed throughout the upper water column. The majority of positive chlorophyll anomalies were due to both an increase of biomass and photo-acclimation while few cases were due to photo-acclimation only.},

The ISO method is accepted as a standard method but requires sample handling and transport to the laboratory. Spectrofluorometry is a sensitive method, even for natural phytoplankton populations. Nevertheless, it cannot be recommended for the quantification of cyanobacterial water blooms because colonial and filamentous species such as Microcystis, Anabaena, or Aphanizomenon display unacceptable variability (18–33\%). The submersible probe featured high correlation with a standard ISO method (r=0.97, P{\textless}0.05). This probe can provide the selective measurement of technologically important phytoplankton groups like cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and cryptophytes in lake vertical profiles of up to 100m. The limitation of this instrument is the possible reabsorption of the light signal, e.g. in the presence of humic substances, or dense algal blooms. The use of submersible probes for in situ phytoplankton quantification can be recommended as a sensitive tool for water management, especially in the case of drinking water resources.},
