This project encompasses my Dissertation on the 'Trends in subsurface phytoplankton Biomass at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study'.

I focused on this work from September 2021 to March 2022.

This project was my entire introduction to Data Analysis in Python, having to learn the language from scratch and many of the concepts as I tackled problems.

Files:
- 'thousand_m_BATS.csv' (267MB) - The first dataset containing 30 years of high freqeuncy CTD (Conductivity/Temperature/Depth) readings Data taken at a survey site in Bermuda. Temperature, Depth, Time and Chl-a were the values I needed to isolate and work with for this project. (due to this file's size, I've uploaded a reduced 95KB file)

- 'BATS_pigment.csv' (532KB) - The second dataset contains 30 years of low freqeuncy/high accuracy Bottle sample data () taken at the same survey site in Bermuda.

Skills involved:
1. Data Collection (online sourcing)
2. Data Cleansing
3. Applying Corrections to Data
4. Modelling of Physical Data and Calibrating alternate data to it
5. Data Transformation
6. Applying data to a complex model
7. Trapizial Integration
8. Linear Regression

Further step by step details of my methods and techiques are available in the 'Data_Crunching_and_Analysis.ipynb' and 'Dissertation_writeup.pdf'.
