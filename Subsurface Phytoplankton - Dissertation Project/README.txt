This project encompasses my Dissertation on the 'Trends in subsurface Phytoplankton Biomass at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-seres study'.

I focused on this work from September 2021 to March 2022.

This project was pretty much my entire introduction to Data Analysis and Modelling in Python, having to learn both the concepts and the language from scratch.

Files:
'thousand_m_BATS.csv' (267MB) - 30 years of high freqeuncy CTD (Conductivity/Temperature/Depth) readings Data taken at a survey site in Bermuda. Temperature, Depth, Time and Chl-a were the values I needed to isolate and work with for this project.
